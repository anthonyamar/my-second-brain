# Breathing gas mixtures in scuba diving : how divers achieve to go deeper. 

When I started practicing scuba diving, I was fascinated by the divers who was going very deep. With the naivety of a beginner, I just didn't think about how it could be done. Then, I succeed my first certification, that allowed me to go only at -20m deep. This is where I started to see that the next -20m will not be that easy to reach without some theoric knowledge about breathing gas. 

After ~30 dives, I wanted to progress in scuba diving and succeed a "level 2 certification", which allow me, among others, to dive assisted with a max operating depth of -40m. I take advantage of this certification (which require 10 dives of diverse exercices) to pass a Nitrox certification. Here it is! My first breath of a gas mixture enriched with oxygen! 

And what a room for improvement: when some of my instructors have been diving deeper than -100m, my personnal record is -36m and I'm already concerned by gas mixture!

This only increased my interest about the gas blending subject in scuba diving : if you want to go deeper, using different gas mixtures is vital. So here's what I've learned about this field. 


## Why do we even need to breath gas mixture? 

TL;DR : to avoid accidents due to bio-physic and bio-chemical reaction of our organism when subject of a higher pressure mostly caused by the nitrogen. 

The air we're breathing everyday (the same that is in our tank by default in scuba diving) is composed at ~78% of [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen), ~21% of [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen) and ~1% of other more rare gases like [argon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon). 

There's two main accident we want to avoid in scuba diving that can justify the need of gas mixture :

- Decompression sickness
- Nitrogen narcosis

## Popular accident caused by pressure and nitrogen

### Decompression sickness

I think this the most popular accident in scuba diving, not because many people are victim, but more because this is the one mainstream documentary are relating to by saying that divers need to make decompression stop. 

Divers are breathing with a mecanism called a [regulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_regulator). The regulator is giving air at the ambiant pressure. When we're on the surface, the pressure is at 1 atmosphere (atm), so your regulator gives air at 1 atm

The pressure increase of 1 atm every 10m. That mean that, when we're at -10m, we're facing 2 atm of pressure (1 atm of surface + 1 atm of depth pressure), -20, 3 atm, -30, 4 atm... and so on. 

One of the basic mecanism with pressure is that, when the pressure increase, volumes decrease and vice versa. 

Deeper you go, higher is the pressure, and more your body is comprimed. So where's the problem? 

Because the regulator is giving you gas at the ambiant pressure, when you're -30m deep, you're breathing air at 4 atm. That means you're breathing 4 times more nitrogen and oxygen in your lungs than you were at the surface. Normaly, nitrogen is a neutral gas at 1 atm, it doesn't transfert to the tissue. But, here at -30m, we're breathing 4 times more nitrogen, so the gas is forced to move to the tissue and then disolve in our blood. 

If we're exposed to too much nitrogen, during a too long period, we start to have the nitrogen narcosis we're talking below, which cause at first, the feel of drunkness. 

But the biggest problem come when we're start to ascend. The pressure decrease causing the increase of volume, and here, the nitrogen that were disolved in our blood because of pressure is forming bubbles that ascend our blood system (just like what we're experiencing when opening a soda bottle) in their turn. This is what cause the decompression sickness : the bubble that are ascending can go to the brain and cause a stroke (which can lead to death ðŸ˜±). 

This is why divers need to make decompression stops. When we're doing a decompression stop, we're eliminating those bubble (we call this desaturating) to avoid the decompression sickness. The longer you stay at high pressure, the longer the stop need to be. In recreationnal scuba diving limited to 20m, the pressure and the exposition time are not sufficiant to force divers doing a decompression stop.

### Nitrogen narcosis

As we were talking before, when we're going deeper, the pressure increase, and so the amount of nitrogen that goes into our tissues and our blood. 

When we're exposed to a long period of too much nitrogen, we start to be narked. What it basically does, it's that we start to have a drunkness feeling. Some people start being narked faster than other, but we people agree that the mean depth that start provoking narcosis is around ~30m for around 10 minutes. 

The deeper you go, the harder is narcosis and this can result in the loss of cognitive senses and worst, loss of biological function.

## Gas mixing to underweight nitrogen

We now have our suspect : nitrogen seems to cause to much threats when diving deep. So one of the main reason we're change the gas mixture is to underweight nitrogen, at first, in profit of oxygen. This mix is called "Nitrox"

## Nitrox

Enriched Air Nitrox (EAN) is a gas mixture where the nitrogen is underweight in profit of oxygen. 

The oxygen concentration depends of the depth you want to go, which is called MOD for Max Operating Depth. I'll talk later on this but, just like nitrogen, oxygen can becaume toxic by going deeper and result in hyperoxia, which is caused by the excess of oxygen supply. The more oxygen concentration there is in the tank, the less depth you can go. 

In recreationnal diving, we're mostly using a mixture with 32% of oxygen (said "Nitrox 32"). It allow us a MOD of -34m. 

Nitrox is prepared with specific gear, such as permeable membrane filter or low pressure oxygen injection and need to be prepared by trained people. 

When we're starting to prepare our equipment for diving, we need to measure the oxygen rate in the bottle using a gas analyzer, and stick to our bottle a sign with our parameters written like this : EAN 32% MOD -34m. This is mostly need to inform other divers. 

Here's the pros of using Nitrox for diving : 

- As there is less nitrogen, we can stay longer at our MOD without the need to make decompression stops. So basically, this mean that we can explore more ðŸ˜Š. 
- It decrease the risk of nitrogen narcosis and decompression sickness
- It reduce post-dive fatigue (the body need to expulse less nitrogen)
- It decrease the risk of accident for people who have a [PFO (patent foramen ovale)](https://www.heart.org/en/health-topics/congenital-heart-defects/about-congenital-heart-defects/patent-foramen-ovale-pfo)
- There's no noticeable change in terms of breathing confort. 

And the cons : 

- More oxygen means more risk of hyperoxia and high-pressure nervous syndrome.
- Contrary to popular belief, Nitrox don't allow us to go deeper. Rather the opposite.
- Diving club charge for Nitrox preparation, so it has an economic disadvantage.

## Trimix

We talked about the most mainstream gas. Even if Nitrox is used by confirmed divers, it has still a great popularity because of the easiness of use and because it can be use for recreational dive. Let's talk now about the mixing gas used for tecnical diving. 

The Trimix, as it's name suggest, is mix of three different gas : oxygen, nitrogen and helium. It is use for technical, commercial and advanced recreational diving. This force the diver to follow a specific training and be equiped with specific diving computers. 

Like the Nitrox, the concentration of each gas depend of the type of dive you'll achieve.

We can class Trimix in multiple categories, mostly based on their oxygen concentration.

### Hyperoxic trimix

Hyperoxic trimix, sometimes called "triox" or "helitrox" are prepared with a higher proportion of oxygen than the usual 21%. 

The most popular concentration is called 26/17 Trimix for 26% oxygen, 17% helium and 57% nitrogen. 

It requires decompression stops similar to Nitrox 32 and has a MOD of 44m. It is breathable on the surface and is mostly use for shallow dives or to optimise the decompression time when ascending.

### Normoxic trimix

Normoxic trimix, as you may guess, is prepared with a normal proportion of oxygen. 

Concentration : between 18% and 21% of oxygen, between 20% to 24% of helium and ~55% of nitrogen. 
We also can adjust the concentration and even get rid of the nitrogen to create what we called an "heliox" mix which consist of 21% oxygen and 79% of helium.

This one can is breathable on the surface and give the ability to dive in the 40m to 60m zone. 

### Hypoxic trimix

Less popular than the two others, the hypoxic trimix is oxygen-depleted. 

This one is concentrated with an oxygen content lower than 18%, then we adjust the balance between helium and nitrogen in order to achieve a specific dive. 

This mix isn't breathable in surface. This means that the diver need to have a specific tank with this mix in addition to his normal mix. (Or to dive with rebreather that will create gas mixes automatically , but this is another story). It use to go deeper than 60m.
