## Where to buy cryptocurrencies?

Cryptocurrencies has been a major boom since 2018 and the Bitcoin first big boom at 18k€. Now Bitcoin is over 45k and don't show any sign of weakening. 

There's a lot of plateform for [investing in cryptocurrencies](Cryptocurrencies.md) and choosing the one depends mostly on the fees or the interface. 

- [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en): a lot of different options and derivative, no fees on SEPA transfers. A great plateform for people who are searching for more than just buy and sell cryptos.
- [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/): the easy way to start. At that time, they're offering a bonus of ~$31 value in alt-coins. They're also let you [earn some cryptos by just watching tutos](https://www.coinbase.com/earn). That's amazing! [Fees](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/pricing-and-fees/fees#variable-fees-by-location-and-payment-method) are about ~ 4% for fulling your account using credit card. SEPA transfers in/out are €0.15
- [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/): Not very different from the other, it seems to have lower fees on transfers to remunerate crypto accounts such as [Nexo](https://nexo.io/) and [Celsius](https://celsius.network/)
