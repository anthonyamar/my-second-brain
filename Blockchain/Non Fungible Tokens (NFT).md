## Unique digital collectibles
NFT, standing for Non Fungible Tokens, are unique digital collectibles that are unable to be replicated because stored on a decentralized #blockchain such as Ethereum. Each item is totally exclusive to its owner and cannot be duplicated or deleted. 

I heard about NFT for the first time on a newsletter about digital art. After digging a bit on this, I discover a whole new usage of the blockchain technology, entirely dedicated to art and collectibles. 

NFT is solving some of the toughest problems for art in the digital era which are : the non uniqueness and the ownership of art pieces. 

The non-fungible aspect is what make NFT so interesting, in opposition to fiat cash. Fiat cash and cryptocurrencies are fungible as they're totaly interchangeable : 5€ bill is interchangeable with any other 5€ bill, just like 1 BTC is interchangeable for 1 BTC. 

The act of creating an NFT is call "Mint". To tokenize an asset you need to bring the file to a minting platform like [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/), [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) or Mintbase. They're all working on Ethereum, so you need to have an Ethereum wallet to record the file. This will cost some ETH, so the price you pay for minting a piece is highly fluctuable.
