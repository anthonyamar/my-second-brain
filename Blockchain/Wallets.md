## Where to store your cryptos? 

Cryptos aren't stored properly said, like money on a bank account or something similar. When you own coins, you don't have them physically. You rather own a pair of public and private cryptographic key. 

The one you need to get secured, is obviously the private key. It's the one use to make outgoing transaction (e.g. send money). 

When using services cited above, you're getting a software wallet that you can secure using 2FA, but it's also possible to store your key in a hardware wallet such as the one made by [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or by [Trezor](https://trezor.io/).
