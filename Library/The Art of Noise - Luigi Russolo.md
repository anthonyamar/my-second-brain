## Review

The Art of Noise is a futurist manifesto wrote in 1913 by the painter and compositor [Luigi Russolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luigi_Russolo), who is often considered as the pioneer of electronicc music, especially the sampler. His instrument, the Russolophone ([Intonarumori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intonarumori) in Italian, litteraly , was an electro-mechanical device controlled to play (often by hiting) various objects that make noise, like cooking tools, metal, glass, boxes etc... Which is very close to what the sampler is.

He wrote this manifesto to state the usage of noise in music. He points that, because of the everyday things mechanization, people hear way more noise than before and that noises are becomming part of our life, as well as more and more diversified. So the fact that using noise to make music make sense.

 He describes his vision and way of organizing the noises in 6 categories:
 1. Loud sounds: Roars, thunderings, explosions, hissing roars, bangs, booms
 2. Windy sounds: whistling, hissing, puffing
 3. Quiet sounds: whispers, murmmurs, mumbling, muttering, gurgling
 4. Scratch sounds: screeching, creaking, rustling, buzzing, crackling, scraping
 5. Material sounds, obtained by beating on: metals, woods, skins, stones, pottery, etc.
 6. Voices of animals and people: shouts, screams, shrieks, wails, hoots, howls, death rattles, sobs. 

Noises are also a way to extend instrument's tone palette. Also, when we start to abandon the notion of rhythm, we can start to develop and renovate our musical thoughts to better consider the sound. 

The manifesto is also an introduction to the concept of "Noise-Sounds", a category of sound that is beyond the actual palette of traditionnal sounds.
> This musical evolution is parallel to the multiplication of machines.

By shifting our mind, being more openminded and geting used to hear those noise-sounds, we could get what he calls the “musical noise”. That's what he aim to explore with the Noise Orchestra he's creating. 
> To surround and tune harmonicaly and rythmicaly those various noises. Noises shouldn't be imitative, but rather used to explore a new way of creating art. The noise variety is virtualy infinite. With the multiplication of machines, we could one day discern 10, 20, 30, `n`, different noises. These will be noises that we should, not only imitate, but combine according to our artistic fantasy.

This book had inspired a lot of artists in their musical experiments. The most known are undoubtly Pierre Schaeffer, John Cage, Pierre Henry, Art of Noise, Kraftwerk and indirectly a lot of electronic music artists.
