## Review

How to Win Friends and Influence People is a book written in 1936 by Dale Carnegie, a famous writter (not related to Andrew Carnegie, the indusrial american entrepreneur) known for his self-development books. 

The ideas are still very up to date. He state 30 rules that will help people to create more meaningful relationships with people and influence, in a good way, the events, and the relationships.
