Like a lot of other people, The 4-Hour Workweek from Time Ferris had a great and huge impact on my life. I mean, who hadn't ever dreamed of working significantly less while still having the same lifestyle? Or even better, having a better life quality than you had while working 35 hours per week? Well, the book start with this strong belief. 

What I really appreciate in this book is that it opened me on a totaly new genre of #personal-development : the professionnal efficiency and the #productivity improvement. 

This was completely new for me, and I read it in the right mood as I was in search of doing more with the different projects I was involved in at that moment. 

The best thing I learned from this book is that ==working hard isn't the only available option==, and worst, not the best at all. I mostly learned that ==working smarter is what really matter==. 

The book also opened my eyes on the fact that alternatives way of living exists and that ==having the lifestyle you want isn't a matter of money==. It's mostly how you decide to work and organize yourself that really improve the way you're living. 

Some concepts, totaly new for me at that time, are now part of what I truly value or refer to such as :
- The scalability principle
- Pareto's law
- The concept of muses (side-projects, kind of)
- Time as ultimate resource and how to value it
- Life long mini retirement instead of the big one 

Even if it was already ~10 years old when I read it and that some concept were a bit outdated (I thinking about #dropshipping i.e.), it is still an awesome book that provide real game chaging ideas for those who'd never been exposed to the kind of thoughts.
