*(original in French : L'encyclopédie du savoir relatif et absolue)*

My mother bought it when I was 10. It is written in a form of very short, curious and surprising stories about various things. This book made me understand for the first time that books could be fun, and arn't only very long and boring stories, and this had a huge impact on my life, even though it seems anecdotal. I still read few passages sometimes even if I already read it 3 or 4 times.
