## Review
Not the best book I've ever read. The title traduction is a bit fallacious, it is translated as "Are we what we read?" and we could esperate a kind of epistemologic book but it is not. It's just a group of 4 little writings from George Orwell on how and why he loosed his faith into books :
- Bookshop Memories
- Confessions of a Book Reviewer
- Good Books Bad Books
- Books vs Cigarettes

A distracting book in sum, that allowed me to ask me the question of passion based works: Does becoming a pro in a domain to which the passion is the catalys (such as arts, books, sports) pushes us necessarily to its weariness? The privation of freedom of *not* reading gives to a book a constraint nature.
