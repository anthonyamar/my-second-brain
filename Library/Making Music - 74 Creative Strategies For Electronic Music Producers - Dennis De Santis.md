## Review
This book is a collection of 74 creative strategies to find new way of making music. It's a very pragmatic and action oriented book that can be used on a daily basis to get us out of traps or fight blank page syndromes. 

All the exemples are made in Ableton but easily transposable on any other DAW. It don't require any prior knowledge on musical theory, on the contrary, it will surely helps beginners (as well as pros) on developping their musical knowledge.
