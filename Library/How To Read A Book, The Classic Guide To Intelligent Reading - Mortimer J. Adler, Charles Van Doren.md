## Review
A very interesting book that help a lot on how to be more efficient when reading. It shows various level of reading and highlight the fact that reading is an art. And like any other art, it need to practice and can be mastered. 

## Related books
Similarly to [How To Take Smart Notes - Sönke Ahrens](How%20To%20Take%20Smart%20Notes%20-%20Sönke%20Ahrens.md), this book emphasize the need of taking notes and questionning the book ([202107032150 Questioning a book to read more actively](202107032150%20Questioning%20a%20book%20to%20read%20more%20actively.md). But on the other side, the authors argue that lay down our thoughts directly on the book. Sönke Ahrens argue that this is an inefficient strategy, as we need to come back to the book and search for the notes without knowing precisely where they're at. This goes in favor of [Zettelkasten](The%20zettelkasten%20method%20and%20how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes.md).

They also highlight the need of reformulating arguments. Compared to Sönke, in their opinion, it's more a matter of verbal act rather than a written act. To achieve reformulation, we can also translate from one language to another. This is great to know for me, as I'm a french guy reading in english. The reformulation could also be done "passively", through syntopical reading. Authors would surely have different manners of expressing their ideas, even if they state the same thing in the end. That's what we face here: both are expressing the need of reformulating, but not the same way and not in contradiction but within a certain complementarity.
