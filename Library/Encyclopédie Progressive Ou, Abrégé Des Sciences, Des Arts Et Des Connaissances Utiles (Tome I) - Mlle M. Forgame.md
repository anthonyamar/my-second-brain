## Review
Paired with [Encyclopédie Progressive Ou, Abrégé Des Sciences, Des Arts Et Des Connaissances Utiles (Tome Ii)](Encyclopédie%20Progressive%20Ou,%20Abrégé%20Des%20Sciences,%20Des%20Arts%20Et%20Des%20Connaissances%20Utiles%20(Tome%20II)%20-%20Mlle%20M.%20Forgame.md).

Great ensemble of two leather books. They were priced at 30€ and got it 10€ the collection. 

The second tom has a bit of leather on the verge of being ripped off, but great condition. 

It's about various words and things on sciences: music, mathematics, mankind, people, physic, optics, rhetoric, metaphysic... The style is interesting, I particulary like the music description:
> Music is the art of arranging and conducting sounds so much that their consonance, their succession and their relative duration result in pleasant sensations.
