## Review
Maybe one of the most famous dystopic #novel of all times. 1984 pleased a lot of people and I do not make exception here. 

Radiohead's 2+2=5 song from the Hail to the Thief album, an obvious reference to 1984, was what prompted me to buy and read it. 

What struck me about this book, is obviously the terrifying similarities you can find with the world we're living, but also the way Orwell make the biggest ideas behind the story that accessible and powerful, because of his way of writing and the love story between Winston and Julia that is going through the entire story. 

There would have a lot to say about this book, about the concepts like the newspeak language,  the slogans, the proletarians, the ministries, the doublethink, Big Brother, the truth, the lie, the mass surveillance, the censorship... This is in fact, one of the most powerful and eye-opening book I read for sure. I read it two times.
