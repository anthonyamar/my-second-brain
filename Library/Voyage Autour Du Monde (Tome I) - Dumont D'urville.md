## Review
Paired with [Voyage Autour Du Monde (Tome I)](Voyage%20Autour%20Du%20Monde%20(Tome%20II)%20-%20Dumont%20D'urville.md). Got these for 90€ the two. 

It's about the travels in multiple countries of 4 french admirals. They're reporting their adventures in foreign places that happened in the first 50 years of the XIXth century. 

At the end, we have a world map from that period, which is very interesting, we can see how different the world was perceive back then. A lot of countries were totally unknown or had no names, and a lot of names are very different. 

Also, the view is centered the same as we have. Now, a map put in the middle of the country where it is made (I think it's true for every country/continent, but not sure). Here, we have in the middle of the Oceania (Australia, that they're calling New Holland), just above what they call "The big Austral Ocean". (litteraly translated from French to English). 

Others: 
- America is called Septentrional America for North and Meridional for the South. 
- North Africa is called "The Barbarity", which says a lot about how North Africans were viewed and treated back then.
