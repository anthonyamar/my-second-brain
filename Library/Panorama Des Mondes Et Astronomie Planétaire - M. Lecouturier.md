## Review
A great semi-leather book in good condition, bought 70€. 24 drawing boards that seem to be chromography. 

It's a science book, about mostly astronomy, planets, the solar system, physics, celestials corpus etc. 

I don't know if the knowledge in it it's still on date as the book is from 1858 and that a lot of things evolve since, but still, it's a gorgeous book.
