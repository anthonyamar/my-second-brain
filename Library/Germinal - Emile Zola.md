## Review
Started on 16/07/21. 
Germinal was out in 1885 and is the 13th (on 20) book of Rougon Macquart's serie. Etienne Lantier is the main character and the story takes place in the mine of Montsou, in the north of France. 

## Chapter notes
### Part I

The part one, divided in 6 chapters, is mostly an overview of all the main characters and take place in the mine and spread over one complete day and is centered on Etienne and the Maheu family. Within this chapter, we also get a very good overview of what was the work in mine. Zola were very well documented about this. It is said that he went to visit a mine in the north of France to better understand the work condition, and that it was this visit that inspired him Germinal. 

The first part is pure Zola: a writing full of raw descriptions and details, with an emphasis on rude things. We can find that style in [Thérèse Raquin](Thérèse%20Raquin%20-%20Émile%20Zola.md).  

#### I
Etienne Lantier, 21 years old, strong despite his slim muscles, arrive in "Le Voreux", a coal mine in the north of France. He meet Bonnemort (can be litteraly translated to Gooddeath), an old carter, nicknamed like this because he escaped death three times: 
1. He escaped a gas blast explosion
2. He narrowly missed being buried
3. His belly got swollen by water

He said having worked from 8 years old in the mine, until 58 years old. So 45 years in the mine and 5 as a carter. Bonnemort is the archetype of a miner that had suffered from his work but don't really know it because he litteraly didn't have any comparaison points. He is in very bad health condition, spitting black spots of coal from his lungs every 5 minutes. He's patiently waiting his retirement and the 180 francs promised of pension.

That first chapter state the difficulty of work as a miner through the health of Bonnemort and set the scene.

#### II
We're now discovering a 12-person family of mining employees, the Maheu. Bonnemort, from his real name Vincent Maheu, is the elder. A very modest family, whom Zola describe as sick, earning very low income, so much so that they do not have enough to eat. 

#### III
Etienne goes to the miner in order to find some work. He finally meet the Maheu family. Catherine, one of the daughter, help him by giving him a work as a miner. It's now Etienne's first discovery of the mine. Zola describe it with vivid details that highlight the awefull conditions in which people work, even from 10 years old.

545m deep with three levels, the first at 315m. Drastic changes of temperature and pressure. At certain places, knee level of cold water and mud. A lot of very tight passages... 

Etienne first thought Catherine was a boy, due to her dressing. He seems to have a crush for her. 

#### IV

Etienne is now working as a miner with Catherine, under the supervision of Chaval and Maheu. Zola describe how hard the work is underneath. They're bent all the time under very humide rocks that let fall water on their head, in a 35°c environement, and with the air filled with gas emanating from the coal (at 90% methane). 

They know that there is a big concentration of natural inflammable gas, thanks to a Davy lamp that shine in blue to indicate its presence and reduce the danger of explosion. 

At 10am, they had their lunch. As Etienne is new here, he didn't have any food, so Catherine shared some bread and coffee with him. We learn more about these two in this chapter: Etienne had been fired because he stapped his boss while he was drunk (the way he talks about it let hear that he's an alcoholic, or at least, have some anger management problems when he's drunk). 

The more he talks with Catherine, the more he finds her attractive, even with her face blackened by coal. He starts asking her age and if she has a boyfriend. Catherine is 15 years old, and she works as a harrow (trad. [Herscheur·euse (FR)](Herscheur·euse.md)). When she said she doesn't have a boyfriend, Chaval come and kiss her by force. This says a lot of girls, *worst*, childs condition back then, on moral and relationships. 

Etienne's mother was a divorced/abandoned laundress in Paris La Goutte d'Or. 


#### V

We're understanding more about how the miners are paid and treated by their hierachy. They have to timber (put wood to support the roof) the flaws in order to avoid landslides, but they're paid only on the weight of coal they bring back to the surface. The hierarchy is here to constraint them to the timbering work and so, they make miners earn less. 

There's also a hint on how they treat horses, seems like they take them down  in the mine to achieve the carry work. Some even died from fear before arriving at the bottom. That means that, in addition to all the atrocious conditions the miner faced, they also had to deal with dead horses in the mine.

#### VI 
The miners are going back to the top. Maheu and Catherine are taking Etienne to a cabaret keeped by Rasseneur, a former miner who opened that cabaret in challenger to The Company *(trad. La Companie)*. After hesitating, Rasseneur finaly give credit for 15 days to Etienne, so he can take one of his two rooms. He changed his mind because Etienne knew a certain Pluchart, who sent a letter to Rasseneur. Pluchart was one of Etienne's manager in his previous job as a machinist, and also the North Company's secretary. 

Etienne accepted to stay even if he's already suffering from the work harshness. Certainely to see Catherine again, but also because an anger feeling toward the Grégoire, rich bourgeois and shareholders of the Mine Company exploiting the miners, start to born.
