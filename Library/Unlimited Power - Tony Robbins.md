If I had to just choose one book that really change the way I think, Unlimited Power from Tony Robbins would be that one. I discover it on a seduction forum when I was ~18 years old, so yes, I basically started to read it because I thought it would help me to pickup girls ðŸ˜‚ 

Well, I did not find how to be more attractive with women in it. ðŸ˜„  But I can say this book had a very huge impact on my life and it learned something way more valuable than how to pickup girls : anything can be learn, and it always can start with a book. So I started compulsively buying books and keeping them from the day I finished this book. Now, I say I'm collecting books. I have more than 260 books now and guess what? My interest for books is still growing. 

The impact was bigger than this. I also became vegetarian at that time, by reading advices from this book about food. I'd been vegetarian for now roughly `Date.today.year - 2011`  years, so the impact this book had is really sustainable.

I grew up in my head, in my motivation, in my #productivity, in my ability to talk to other people... Definitely a key book for me. I read it three times.
