## Review

A [scuba diving](Scuba%20diving.md) book that highlight the best diving sites in the world with some hints about seasons and things to do. I'm using it to plan a [Scuba diving round-the-world trip](Scuba%20diving%20round-the-world%20trip.md).

Not the most detailed book, but it's great to have a starting point before going deeper on certain destinations.
