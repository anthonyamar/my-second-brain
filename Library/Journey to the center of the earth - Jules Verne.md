*(original in French : Voyage au centre de la terre)*

This book was my first contact with Jules Verne's genius. This is the first book I read pro actively. It was here for years in my bedroom's library (that was my grand father's bedroom before), and I started to read it not only because the title sounded familiar to me, but because I was really borred back in the days. It was the year of my eighteens, just after I was kicked from school. I had ne real plans for the future but music and wanted to bring some changes in my life and that it would maybe start by reading more. I was damn right! ðŸ¤¯

Here's a photo of a Jules Verne - Hetzel's cover. One of my dream book! I started [collecting old books](Collecting%20old%20books.md) because of these! Still my goal to have this specific title and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas in Hetzel's original edition. ðŸ˜„
