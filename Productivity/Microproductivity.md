## Create small achievable tasks out of big dreams

Microproductivity is about making and achieving small tasks out of bigger tasks. We tend to struggle achieving too big goals as the path to the finish line may seems fuzzy. 

Making very small tasks helps having a clearer path of what to do. Everything becomes now more achievable than before as we get faster and more regular feedbacks from ticking the tasks. 

Atomic tasks also dump the limited brain's [Working memory](Working%20memory.md). As we're able to handle and hold a significantly small amount of information in our working memory, breaking out things helps a lot. It makes every tasks or achievements more digest.  

It's one of the core principle of productivity. Atomicity is key when it comes to achieving things, whether it's [Adopting new habits](Adopting%20new%20habits.md), [digital gardening](Digital%20garden.md) through [Atomic design applied to digital gardening](Atomic%20design%20applied%20to%20digital%20gardening.md) and even planning a big trip like a [Scuba diving round-the-world trip](Scuba%20diving%20round-the-world%20trip.md). 

If we had only one quote for microproductivity, it will be [this Chinese quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_journey_of_a_thousand_miles_begins_with_a_single_step):
> A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step

Microproductivity is all about determining the steps.
