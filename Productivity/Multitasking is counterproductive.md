## Why multitasking is counterproductive?

As the name would suggest, multitasking "technic" that consist in doing multiple tasks at the same time. People who're doing this often think they're more productive but [studies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797618801013) proved this wrong. 

Multitasking isn't focusing on multiple things at the same time. We litteraly can't, we don't have multiple brains. Only computers can do this by alocating resources to different CPU cores that runs at the same time. We're rather switching attention quickly between tasks, which inevitably leads to [Ego depletion](Ego%20depletion.md) and deficit attention because each new task need a little of willpower to be started.

By avoiding multitasking we can lower this fatigue and focus on one single thing longer. If we're tempted to multitask, we better write a memo about what to do to unclutter our mind. As our short memory is limited to maximum of seven items to remember, writting things down and [Externalizing thoughts](Thinking%20in%20writing.md) can help free your mind in order to be more focus.
