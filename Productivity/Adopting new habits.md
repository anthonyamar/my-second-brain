## How do we adopt new habits? 

New habits are adopted by creating satisfying and repeatable experiences. An habit is an habit once the action you're achieving no longer need willpower to be done. 

Adopting a new habit is a matter of time and repetition. Depending on the complexity or the amount of willpower needed, the new habit can take a week or three month to be adopted. 

Adopting habits are easier for people with a [Growth mindset](Growth%20mindset.md), as they're constantly searching for feedback and get pleasure out of changing for the better ([How To Take Smart Notes - Sönke Ahrens](How%20To%20Take%20Smart%20Notes%20-%20Sönke%20Ahrens.md)). 

Creating new habits are difficult, that's why we need to break big changes into multiple tiny changes and embrace it step by step. Abrupt changes will need too much willpower and will inevitably lead in abandon by fatigue. This is also true for too much changes. Ones can't break and/or adopt too much habits at the same time. Better breaking into multiple steps using the [[Microproductivity]] principle. Even though I didn't read it, I think this what James Clear's "Atomic Habit" book is relating to.
