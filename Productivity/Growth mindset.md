## Growth vs. fixed mindset
Opposed to the Fixed Mindset, where intelligence is describe as static, people with a Growth Mindset, are described by Carol S. Dweck as it : 
> Leads to a desire to learn and therefore a tendency to :
> - Embrace challenges
> - Persist in the face of setbacks
> - See effort as the path to mastery
> - Learn from criticism
> - find lessons and inspiration in the success of others. 

While a fixed mindset shows a deterministic view of the world, the growth mindset gives people a greater sense of free will and result in reaching ever-higher levels of achievements. 

Seeking for feedback and get pleasure out of changing for the better ([How To Take Smart Notes - Sönke Ahrens](How%20To%20Take%20Smart%20Notes%20-%20Sönke%20Ahrens.md)) is part of the growth mindset.
