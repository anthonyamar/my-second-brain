## Externalizing thoughts

Thinking in writing is about externalizing our thoughts to any other medium. As we're limited in ~ seven items to remember in our short term memory (STM - Miller, 1956), writing helps unclutter our STM and keep free space available to store more important things to remember. 

Externalizing our thoughts also helps us fighting the [Zeigarnik effect](Zeigarnik%20effect.md) that state the tasks' propension to fill our mind until they're finished or written down. 

Externalizing thought could be on paper, on a todo list if it's a task, or in our #second-brain or [Zettelkasten](The%20zettelkasten%20method%20and%20how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes.md) slipbox.
