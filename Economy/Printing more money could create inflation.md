Printing more money could create inflation. As money exist only because of the trust we're putting in it and the value it represents, injecting more liquidity (fiat and/or scriptural) will increase the overall amount of money for the same value and goods. So it'll force people to sell goods at higher price to keep up with the now, new normality. 

This is how more money could just create inflation. In order to be richer, a country can't just print more money, it have to increase the volume of transactions (goods), said differently, its productivity. A rise in the overall money, decorelated from value, is symptomatic of a financial crisis. +~25% of money in circulation were what contributed to create the 1929 crisis. 

In general, injecting free materials, or things that will end up in money in a given economy can have disastreous effects. This is what fragilize the stability of a market.

This is what happened in Africa with the free clothes given by european/north emisphera countries. By selling/giving those clothes to people, non-profit had fragilise the economic stability of fashion and clothers market in these countries. Because of this free clothes, the actual industries had to compete with newly business that get their product for free and can make profit even if they price were set very low. 

As the African businesses that had regular costs for getting their raw materials couldn't compete and sell goods, the industry started to fall, resulting in the dismissal of hundred of millions of people. Beucase they had no job, they stoped consumming and as one's spending is other revenue, the overall economy started to fall too.

This also created a big dependency of African countries toward more developped countries. To solve this, the concerned countries started to legiferate the donations, even forbid it, in order to bring back stability and sovereignty.
