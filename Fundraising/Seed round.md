## Seed
The first fundraising a startup does is called a "seed round". Depending on the round you're trying to achieve, the rules differs. 

Notes about the seed round :
- From 300k€ to 1.5m€
- Mostly from business angels (BA) and seed round venture capitalists ([VC](VC%20lists.md))
- Startups with a working Proof of Concept (PoC)
- Mostly about the team, the vision and the product
- Great KPIs are (not exhaustive, depending on your field) :
	- From 10k€ VAT excluded monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
	- A traction proof like 10k users for free B2C apps
	- First big account for B2B apps
	- Working prototype and crowdfunding or 1k user waiting list for hardware products
	- 20% Month over Month growth (MoM growth) on your main KPI
- Mean dilution about 25% (from 20% to 30%)
- From 1m€ to 2.5m€ pre money valuation
