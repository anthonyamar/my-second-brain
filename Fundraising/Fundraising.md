## Fundraising for startups

I think fundraising is the most discussed #startup topic. Fundraising can be in short resume in "Exchange company capital for cash". This is a process that takes time and where informations are scattered everywhere.

We had a lot of wise advices about fundraising and, as this is a process we're on right now with [Studiomatic](https://www.studiomatic.co/en/), I'm taking a lot of notes about, searching for articles, advices, checklists, etc... So let's share it here!

<mark class="red">Disclaimer</mark> : Fundraising is far from being an absolute science. But what I'm sure, is that the process is very different depending on your company, country, metrics, industry, business-model, advancement, contacts and experience... Theses notes are made through the prism of my own company and experience in the french ecosystem so they might not be true for you, your startup and your ecosystem. 

## Where to start when fundraising
When I ask this to my friends, other CEOs, investors or even Google, I often get this answer : ==start by knowing why you want to fundraise==.

Starting a fundraising need to be crystal clear about why you want to raise, how much and how you'll spend the money. 

## Why you need to raise money
Because there's some good and some bad reasons. 

### ❌ Bad reasons
- You have an idea and you need money to create your product
- You want to test a new #business-model 
- You need money to save your company from bankruptcy 
- You think this is the only way to have money as a startup
- You think this will make you famous

### ✅ Good reasons
- Your company is growing and you want to go faster
- You have a profitable business-model that you can scale or repeat and you want money to go big on this
- Your business work on a city and you want to open new cities or countries
- You want to hire more people and scale because you see opportunities
