## Lemlist's CEO $20m pitch to a VC

Fundraising pitchs are commonly very confidential. Guillaume Moubeche, CEO @ [Lemlist](https://www.lemlist.com/), a B2B SaaS for sales using cold emailing strategies had made public the pitch he did to Pascale Diaine, [VC](VC%20lists.md) from [Storm Ventures](https://www.stormventures.com/).

He share with a high transparency his key metrics for Lemlist, which is really interesting in many point, not just from a B2B SaaS perspective. It's also very great to see what kind of questions Pascale asks to Guillaume, it raise some good points on what she's focus on when it comes to understanding his business, which KPIs she value at this stage etc...

### Some takeaways:
- Guillaume key arguments are mostly their impressive bootstrapped growth, with as the main KPI, the companys' ARR : $4.4m in Q4 2020.
- His goal for funding is ==highly focus on international growth==.
- To achieve this, he highlight the fact that they'd cracked up their sales process using ==highly detailed sales playbook==.
- He ramp up a sales in 2.5 month. Which mean that the sales is "profitable" and reach his targets in 2.5 month
- He asks for a ==$70m - $80m pre-money valuation for his $20m round==.
- He know perfectly his KPIs even if he had a note on his computer in backup
- They measure a lot of thing for each stage of their sales pipline, like segments, conversions, churn, retention, MoM growth for each KPIs, sales efficiency
- He ==assumes and speaks with great authenticity of Lemlist's weaknesses==, mostly about their product. 
- He use [Clearbit](https://clearbit.com/) to enrich and score each new sign up to then send the client to a specific sales pipeline, using mostly inbound marketing.
- Their sales playbook is totaly online so they can teach about each step with more control and efficiency and so have faster ramp ups
- Their [sales efficiency](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/sales-efficiency) is at 8.9. which mean that 1$ spent on sales marketing in Q1 would bring them back $8.9 in new ARR in Q2. *(Not very sure, but according to their explaination, that's seems what it mean.)*
- He offers himself to give Pascale access to Lemlist's financial datas, directly in Profit Well and Stripe
