## VC lists
When raising money, choosing which VC to contact is extremely important : raising money isn't only about money, is also a lot about finding new partners that would advise your company during good and bad times. Choosing the right partners is  important. 

Also, VC don't invest in every company. They're following what we called an "investment thesis", which is the kind of company they're puting money. When searching to contact VC, make sure they criteria matches your company:
- Funding stage (pre-seed, [Seed round](Seed%20round.md), post-seed, A series, B series...)
- Field of expertise (SaaS, B2B, B2C, deep-tech, bio-tech, food-tech, music-tech...)
- Average ticket in € (I.e, don't reach a VC with 1m€ min ticket if you're raising 200k€)
- Predilection countries
- Funded portfolio

If your startup is in an incubator or an accelerator, you can ask for introductions, wich is the best way to have your first contact. Some of them, like [Station F](My%20journey%20at%20Station%20F.md), have dedicated online spaces and advisors for helping about fundraising and getting contact with VC and BA.
