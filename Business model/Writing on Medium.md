## Earn money by writing on Medium

I discovered Medium when I started coding, because a lot of tutorials for code are on Medium. I always thought about writing some things on Medium, mostly because I like to write. I tried one time, write an article about my company, but not more than this. I have difficulties about commiting to a specific writing rhythm when it comes to write blog posts. 

Last day, I was thinking about how to start having people reading my [digital garden](Digital%20garden.md), and figured out that Medium could have a role in getting people here. I also know that Medium remunerate the writters, even though it's not a big amount of money, it's still something cool for extra coffee and motivate better writings. I made some search about the topic of making money with Medium, so here's what I find. 

## How much you could earn?

Everyone more or less agrees that, for ~95% of the writers on Medium, earn less than $100 per month. Depending on your goals, it can still be cool, especially if you're not writing to make a living from Medium. 

The earning is about how you succeed to engage people on Medium, so it's about how much lifetime views you have, the reading time, and how long the tail is. 

According to Zulie Rane's article ["How much money are 1,000 views worth on Medium?"](https://bettermarketing.pub/how-much-money-is-1-000-views-worth-on-medium-5526ef0fe5a3), she have an average $15 per 1,000 views. 

## How to start? 

Not to mention that the obvious way to start earning money on Medium is by writing, there's others things interesting to know :
- To earn money, you have to be a paid user ($5/month or $50/year)
- You need to ==sign up for the Medium Partner Program==
- You need to have a Stripe Account (they're obviously using Stripe Connect)
- Once you signed up for the Medium Partner Program, you need to complete taxpayer informations as an individual or a company to receive payments
- The program arn't retro-active, so if you had previously published stories, you can't earn money from the views already made
- About writing, something very important everyone's talking about is the [Medium Curation Guidelines](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006362473-Medium-s-Curation-Guidelines-Everything-Writers-Need-to-Know) to follow if you want your article to be eligible for payment.
