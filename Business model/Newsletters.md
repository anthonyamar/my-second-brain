## What are the business models for newsletters?

Newsletters is a trendy topic that recently find great #business-model. I get more and more interested by the business model around content generation, such as videos, blogs, newsletters and so on. 

I talked about a french #newsletter in my [personal finances](Personal%20finances.md) plot called "[Snowball](https://www.snowball.xyz/)", which is about personal finance management. 

In his [2020 report](https://www.snowball.xyz/p/-le-snowball-report-2020), Yoann, the founder of Snowball, detail a lot about his business model and his metrics. He advocates for a lot of transparency around how he make money from the newsletter and where goes that #money, which is very interesting in multiple ways. 

Some key points :
- [Freemium](Freemium.md) business model
- [Substack](https://substack.com/home) is the go to plateform for newsletter [MVP](MVP%20(Minimum%20Viable%20Product).md). They take 10% fees in addition to those of [Stripe](https://stripe.com)
- I.e, after removing the fees and the share of French taxes for a 6€/month subscription, the writter get 3€43/month, i.e. 57,17%. of the total amount. 
- Snowball have 19,65% of paid subscriber which is 2 to 3 times better than the average percentage of** user to customer conversion rate** for freemium, with a 31,6% **MoM growth**. 
- His **churn rate**, at 2,31%, is about 50% inferior to the average 5-7%. 
- His **opening rate** for free content is 56,73 and 75,7% for premium content, i.e. 33,44% more opening for premium content. Which is above the industry standard of 35%-62% average for free content and 47%-64% for premium content, according to [this article](https://blog.yirla.com/what-is-a-good-open-rate-for-a-email-newsletter-substack-newletter-startingpoint/).
