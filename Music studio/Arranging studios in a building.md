## What's the best way to arrange studios in a building? 
In order to avoid sound emergence (or reduce it the most we can at least) betseen studios, we could rethinkg how we're arranging the entire building and space around studios by mixing common parts and studios. 

The goal here is to have the fewest adjacent studios. And if possible, reduce the cost of soundproofing 

**We could separate the rooms with : **
- Storage zones
- Chill zones
- Sanitories
- Building machines and technical rooms
- Corridors

**Questions are : **
- How to keep a good â‚¬/m2 ratio with this different kind of arranging studios?
- Will the spaces between studios be enough to succeed in reducing the soundproofing cost without losing efficiency?

## Rearranging example

It could be like rearranging this :

In this :

It's nearly the same surface for each specific element, but by rearranging like this, we could lighten the soundproofing infrastructure (and the cost) for the studios 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7. Every time we have a studio followed by a common space, we could make thiner walls than usual and use the natural soundproofing effect of air and spaces. 

## Arranging studios by type
If the building is mixing different types of studios, i.e. rehearsal, production, recording, dance, podcast, it can be a wise decision to group them together and spaces sort it by the soundproofing efficiency needed for each. 

Needs for each type :
- Recording studio need to be very isolate from all of the outcomming noise but generate high pressure and volumes sound due to drum or reampings. 
- Dance studios have low airborne sounds volume, but high impact sounds and don't need to have a total silence during sessions.
- Rehearsal studios have very high volume both airborn and impact sounds, mostly on low frequencies due to drum, and need to be isolated from the outside. 
- Production studios, isn't producing volumes like rehearsal studio but need a calm environment for composing. Vocal booth can also strengthen the soundproofing and achieve better vocal recording quality
- Podcast studio need calm environement but don't produce noise. 

Strategy :
- Isolate recording studios from other studios
- Pair dance and podcast studios together
- Pair rehearsal studios together
- Pair production studios together
- Bring near rehearsal and production studio in the building
- Bring near recording studios and dance studios
