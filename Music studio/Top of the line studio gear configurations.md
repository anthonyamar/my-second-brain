We are often contacted by top charts artist for conceiving their studios, mostly by rap artists. Choosing the perfect configuration is something really challenging. 

We need to perfectly know the trait of each gear and also deeply understand how the artist work, what he want to achieve and how he want to sound. 

Depending on the artist, it's also important to take into account the budget dimension. Some of them don't talk about budget because they just want the best for them, while others want to keep in a certain range of budget. 

Here's a top of the line studio gear configuration with different pieces for each role :
