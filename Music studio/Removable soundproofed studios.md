[Soundproofing](Soundproofing.md) a studio is very expansive and exacting. When creating studios in a place, you need to be 100% sure that you will stay very long, I mean, more than 10 years. 

It's also risky to create music studios in some places like apartment or offices building. If the soundproofing isn't totally neat, the neighboors will feel bass vibrations or have sound emergencies in their rooms. Which will inevitably lead to complaints, police, trial and you'll maybe force to close the studios. 

So when this arrive and that you need to move out there's two options :
- You put a cross on your infrastructures and start from scratch new studios.
- You have removable studios, so you just dismantle them and put them back to your new place. 

Creating removable studios will obviously cost more upfront than regular studios made with non removable materials (like plasterboards things i.e.), but this will be always less expansive than throwing out all of your work and start from scratch. 

To create removable soundproofed studios, we need to care about a lot of things :
- Soundproofing
- Materials
- Access (door)
- Electricity
- Connectivity (internet...)
- Air flux (input and output)
- Wall coating
- Fire security
- Standards
- Dismantling
- Mounting
- Transport
- Labeling
- Acoustic
- Financial aspect
