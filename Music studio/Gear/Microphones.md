Choosing the right microphone is something hard. Each voice is unique so a microphone that could fit for a certain person may not be suitable at all for another one. 

Objective specs to check when choosing a microphone : 
- The frequency range. Mostly between 20Hz - 20kHz
- Maximum SPL in dB
- Directivity : cardioid, hypercardioid, supercardioid, omnidirectional, bi-directional
- Signal-to-noise ratio in dB 
- Sensitivity in mV/Pa

- [Neumann U87](https://www.thomann.de/fr/neumann_u87_studio_set_ni.htm) - ~2500€, legendary mic, very versatile. 
- [Neumann TLM 107](https://www.thomann.de/fr/neumann_tlm_107.htm) - ~1200€, lot of directivities and pads.
- [Antelope Edge Duo](https://en.antelopeaudio.com/products/edge-duo/) - ~1100€. Modeling microphone to use with Antelope Edge Simulation. Better alternative to the Slate Digital ML-1 below.
- [Neumann TLM 103](https://www.thomann.de/fr/neumann_tlm_103.htm) - ~900€, based on the U67 and U87 microphone capsule. 
- [Slate Digital ML-1](https://www.thomann.de/fr/slate_digital_ml_1matte_black.htm) - ~800€, a very neutral microphone that comes with the VMS software which allows emulating a lot of different microphones with outstanding results. It's like a swiss knife. Seems to be better with the [VMS One Preamp](https://www.thomann.de/fr/slate_digital_vms_one_preamp.htm) (~450€)
- [Aston Microphone Origin](https://www.thomann.de/fr/aston_microphones_origin.htm) - ~220€ low price microphone but still very good. Very robust. Lot of headroom and sensivity.
