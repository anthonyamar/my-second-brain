The most obvious usage is for guitar, which is the instrument that use the most of this effect, but any instrument can benefit from it. 

There's a lot of distortion pedal available on the market, but racks and studio units also exist.

The sound engineer who mixed one of my E.P. used it on my guitar for a track and I never look back after that. Warm, precise, yet not too present, but really adding value and color to the sound.
