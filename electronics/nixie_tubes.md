# Nixie tubes

Nixie tubes are awesome looking tubes that contains a wire-mesh anode and multiple cathodes shaped like numerals or symbols. The tube is filled with gas at low pressure, usually neon mixed with argon or/and mercury. 

The most commons Nixie tubes are used to display numbers. It was introduced in 1955 by Burroughs Corporation and was mostly use as numeric displays in early digital measure machine : voltmeters, multimeters, frequency counters. The official production were stop by the 1990. 

Their retro-futurist look provide it a raise of popularity in the DIY community to create steampunk looking electronis machines.

### Calculator

This one seems to be created by [Das Kabinett Watches](https://www.instagram.com/daskabinettwatches/?hl=en), that usually create steampunks watches.

### Watches

This one was see on Steve Wosniak's wrist. It was his watch before Apple watche release. How cool is that? ‚åöÔ∏è

### High speed cameras calibration display for NASA

As Nixie tubes can go up to 100 000 changes per seconds the NASA ask the modern Nixie tubes manufactor Dalibor Farny (see above) to create a display using this technology to be able to calibrate 100 000 fps cameras (üò±)

## How Nixie tubes are created? 

By looking about Nixie tubes on YouTube, I found this video from Dalibor Farny that show the whole creation process of a hand crafted Nixie tube and everything. I learned a lot on how tubes are made while watching his videos. What an awesome piece of engineering!  

Checkout his website which is as beautiful as his creations : https://www.daliborfarny.com/
