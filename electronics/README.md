# Electronics

I started for the first time learning electronics when I was in highschool. I discover on the internet that some people were able to create their own guitar pedal for almost half of the price of ones on the market and sometimes, with even better quality. I was something like 15 years old and by founding this, I discover the DIY (Do It Yourself) mouvement. This totaly smash my mind and open a whole world to me. I understood now that manufactured things were at first, created by persons that were just regular people, just like me! 

First, it was the financial aspect that drove my will to learn electronic. I didn't have money to buy guitar pedals, so I decided that I will learn how to create one by myself. Fortunatly, I had a soldering iron in my basement and I started by "canibalising" (act of recovering electronics composant from machines) all the electronics goods I was finding (my parents wasn't very happy by the way ðŸ˜…) to get components and try to create pedals. 

I never did really big projects and doesn't have great skills in electronics though, but I still have a lot of fun trying to. This learned me how to solder with precision, repair electronics goods by myself to save (a lot of) money and drove me to the land of prototyping boards, first with Arduino then in the awesome Raspberry Pi's universe!
