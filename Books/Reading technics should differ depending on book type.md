Reading tehnics might differ depending on the type of book or paper. We didn't read non-fiction the same way we're reading novels or guides. 

For non-fiction, we might read fast by abstracting all the lyricism around specific concepts to then read slower and take pauses to understand unfamiliar concepts and ideas as well as taking some notes. The reading profile through time would be very winding. It also not be very rare to come back to the book later to just search for a specific byte of information. 

For novels, we might read at constant speed in order to keep the focus and the history thread. The reading focus will be more on the syntax, the vocabulary and the emotions that the author wants to give. As novels are very descriptive, I'll not be choked to learn that the brain is calling the visual cortex way more than the part of the brain that connects concepts and ideas, maybe more used for non-fiction book. 

Depending on the type, the [Note-taking process](The%20zettelkasten%20method%20and%20how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes.md) will also be different : the attention to detail might not be the same for non-fiction or novels, as well as the things selected or the ratio [Litterature note](Litterature%20note%20to%20quote%20and%20reference%20content.md) / [Fleeting note](Fleeting%20notes%20to%20capture%20thoughts.md)

Contrary to what [Speed reading](Speed%20reading.md) gourous could say, no technics can rule all the different [[mental models]] we need to read a book.
