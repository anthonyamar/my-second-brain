I like to see classical French author from the XIXth century as kind of sociologists. It's striking how we can associate sins and specific social traits to their book's characters and how characters from differents author have similar moods. 

I found a lot of similarities in, i.e., [Thérèse Raquin](Thérèse%20Raquin%20-%20Émile%20Zola.md), [Eugénie Grandet](Eugénie%20Grandet%20-%20Honoré%20De%20Balzac.md) and [Pauline](Pauline%20-%20George%20Sand.md) from Zola, Balzac and Sand. They all have well pronounce sins and character traits that are good social study subjects. 

We can also say that they're all acting like politicians. At least, they're all politically engaged. They're often denounce social inequality or work forces, like in [Germinal - Emile Zola](Germinal%20-%20Emile%20Zola.md) that talk about the miner revolution in the North of France or where he take position on Dreyfus touchy case with his press publication "J'accuse" that value him a trial and a financial condamnation.
