## What are the books that changed my life?

In a certain manner, all the [books](Books.md) I read improved my life. Some had a little impact but still, while others just broke some my toughest pre-conceived ideas and opened brand thinking paradigms. 

That's what I love and I'm searching for by reading books. These moments when you read something so powerful, impacting and evident that it litteraly change your deepest thoughts and push yourself toward being a better person are pure gold. 

I think that every book have this ability, but not at every moment. 

What is spectacular with books, is that you can read one same book dozens of times and you'll still understand things differently.

The way we perceive information in a given in book seems to vary a lot, depending on your current mindset, mood, needs, subjects that matter to you and the things you learnt before starting this book. 

This is why I think that every book can change ones, but the timing is crucial. I also admmit that some books, because of their writing qualities, are more akind to provoque these changes.
