## What are the books that changed my life?

In a certain manner, all the [books](Books.md) I read improved my life. Some had a little impact but still, while others just broke some my toughest pre-conceived ideas and opened brand thinking paradigms. 

That's what I love and I'm searching for by reading books. These moments when you read something so powerful, impacting and evident that it litteraly change your deepest thoughts and push yourself toward being a better person are pure gold. 

I think that every book have this ability, but not at every moment. 

What is spectacular with books, is that you can read one same book dozens of times and you'll still understand things differently.

The way we perceive information in a given in book seems to vary a lot, depending on your current mindset, mood, needs, subjects that matter to you and the things you learnt before starting this book. 

This is why I think that every book can change ones, but the timing is crucial. I also admmit that some books, because of their writing qualities, are more akind to provoque these changes. 

Here's my personal pick of "Life changing books":

## The relative and absolute encyclopedia of knowledge - Bernard Weber
*(original in French : L'encyclopÃ©die du savoir relatif et absolue)*

My mother bought it when I was 10. It is written in a form of very short, curious and surprising stories about various things. This book made me understand for the first time that books could be fun, and arn't only very long and boring stories, and this had a huge impact on my life, even though it seems anecdotal. I still read few passages sometimes even if I already read it 3 or 4 times.

## Journey to the center of the earth - Jules Verne
*(original in French : Voyage au centre de la terre)*

This book was my first contact with Jules Verne's genius. This is the first book I read pro actively. It was here for years in my bedroom's library (that was my grand father's bedroom before), and I started to read it not only because the title sounded familiar to me, but because I was really borred back in the days. It was the year of my eighteens, just after I was kicked from school. I had ne real plans for the future but music and wanted to bring some changes in my life and that it would maybe start by reading more. I was damn right! ðŸ¤¯

Here's a photo of a Jules Verne - Hetzel's cover. One of my dream book! I started [collecting old books](Collecting%20old%20books.md) because of these! Still my goal to have this specific title and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas in Hetzel's original edition. ðŸ˜„

## Unlimited Power - Tony Robbins
If I had to just choose one book that really change the way I think, Unlimited Power from Tony Robbins would be that one. I discover it on a seduction forum when I was ~18 years old, so yes, I basically started to read it because I thought it would help me to pickup girls ðŸ˜‚ 

Well, I did not find how to be more attractive with women in it. ðŸ˜„  But I can say this book had a very huge impact on my life and it learned something way more valuable than how to pickup girls : anything can be learn, and it always can start with a book. So I started compulsively buying books and keeping them from the day I finished this book. Now, I say I'm collecting books. I have more than 260 books now and guess what? My interest for books is still growing. 

The impact was bigger than this. I also became vegetarian at that time, by reading advices from this book about food. I'd been vegetarian for now roughly `Date.today.year - 2011`  years, so the impact this book had is really sustainable.

I grew up in my head, in my motivation, in my #productivity, in my ability to talk to other people... Definitely a key book for me. I read it three times.

## 1984 - Georges Orwell
Maybe one of the most famous #dystopic novel of all times. 1984 pleased a lot of people and I do not make exception here. 

Radiohead's 2+2=5 song from the Hail to the Thief album, an obvious reference to 1984, was what prompted me to buy and read it. 

What struck me about this book, is obviously the terrifying similarities you can find with the world we're living, but also the way Orwell make the biggest ideas behind the story that accessible and powerful, because of his way of writing and the love story between Winston and Julia that is going through the entire story. 

There would have a lot to say about this book, about the concepts like the newspeak language,  the slogans, the proletarians, the ministries, the doublethink, Big Brother, the truth, the lie, the mass surveillance, the censorship... This is in fact, one of the most powerful and eye-opening book I read for sure. I read it two times.
