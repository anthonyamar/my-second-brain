Speed reading is a [mental model](mental%20models.md) that is used to improve the reading speed. 

Reading speed is measured using the Word Per Minute (WPM) metrics and score to a comprehensive survey. 

There's some reluctances from people about speed reading, saying that we lose the pleasure of a book by reading it too fast. We need to keep in mind that speed reading is just a tool we add to our reading toolbox, not the prerogative of reading. It's like having a Ferrari : this is not because you have a sport car that can go to 300km/h that you always need to drive that fast. A Ferrari also has the ability to run at 20km/h and let you see the landscape while you're driving. 

To be more precise, we should rather talk about "variable-speed-reading". The speed should be choose according to the type of book we're reading and the goal we want to achieve. 

Speed reading combine multiple technics, most of them are reading with a guide in hand and using it to let our eyes browse with certains patterns : jump words, speed up the cadence, read sentences backwards, scanning a document, transversal reading... 

It's also a real fight against the voice in our head that constantly say what you're reading and back reading (when you read back a sentence because you think you didn't understand it). It is say that these slows you and reading without these can speed up the reading without altering the comprehension. 

One of the most known author on speed reading is Tony Buzan, who's also well known for popularizing [[Mind maps]].
