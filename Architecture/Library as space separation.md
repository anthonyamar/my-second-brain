A beautfiul yet simple way to combine space, beauty, and usability of a library is to use it as an ark to separate rooms from each other without having a plain separation. This is very elegant, especialy if filled with [old and rare books](Collecting%20old%20books.md)

By also filling the ark with collectibles, the library will take a real decorative and useful aspect to a room. 

If we watch carefuly, we can see that its mostly standard library with a very large wood plank at the top to support the book above the passage. We just need to be careful to the weight that the floor will have to support and being sure of our exploitation charge. (Expressed in kg/m2)
