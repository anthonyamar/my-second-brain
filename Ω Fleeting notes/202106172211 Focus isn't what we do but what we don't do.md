Focus isn't a matter of what we do but what we don't do. It's about abstracting everything around us in order to focus only on a specific task. Simply: make space to have the peace of mind and being focus on what really matter.

Saying no to distractions, meetings, new projects or any activity that can hijack you from making the things that matter is the real focus.
