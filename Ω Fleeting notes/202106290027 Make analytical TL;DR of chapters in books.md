To get a better trace of a book, in the [Note-taking process](The%20zettelkasten%20method%20and%20how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes.md), we could append a chapter to books that will be just analytical TL;DR (Too Long ; Didn't Read) of each chapters on the table of content. If made by the author himÂ·herself, it could give great takeways to the readers in his [Inspectional reading](Inspectional%20reading.md) process. But it's very rare to have this, so we better make it ourselves. It will also help to prepare [Re-reading books](Re-reading%20books.md) by outlining the chapters we will want to give a deeper watch.
