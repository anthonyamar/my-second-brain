Practice jazz improvisation using licks by following the learning phases will help to improve our musicianship. This force other musician's lick appropriation. 

- Elaboration: Learning the lick and understanding its context (key, notes, intervals)
- Spacing: playing it at different moments in a solo
- Variation: playing it in different keys, tempos, octaves or neck emplacement. Chop, slice and change rythm also force appropriation
- Contextual interference: embed the lick in a context by finding way to get in and get out.
- Retrievial: deliberately place licks in a solo with multiple variations
