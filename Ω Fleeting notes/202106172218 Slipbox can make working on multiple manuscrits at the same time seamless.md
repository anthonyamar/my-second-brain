Working on multiple manuscrits at the same time is possible and easier using the slipbox. As the slipbox is constantly creating new connections and generating new ideas from it, we can work on multiple projects at the same time by just switching from one to another when we're not inspired. 

Even though it is say that [Multitasking is counterproductive](Multitasking%20is%20counterproductive.md), working on multiple manuscrit like it's heard here isn't on the same temporality than what we're when talking about multitasking. 

Here, the switches from one project to another can be really slower and only triggered by a lack of motivation or just a higher state of imagination and inspiration about an other subject. 

By allowing us to do this, we're fairly excluding the floating moment and the probabilities of falling in the blank page syndrom. ([202106152252 Imposing restrictions to fight the blank page syndrome](202106152252%20Imposing%20restrictions%20to%20fight%20the%20blank%20page%20syndrome.md))

And because every note in our slipbox has the potential of ending in an article and that [writing a lot trigger the large number theory on finding great topics](202106172137%20Writing%20a%20lot%20trigger%20the%20large%20number%20theory%20on%20finding%20great%20topics.md), it would be a shame to not take these native feature to work on multiple things at the same time.
