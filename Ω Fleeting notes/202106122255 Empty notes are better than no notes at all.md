Having an empty note on a specific subject in our #slipbox or our [Digital garden](Digital%20garden.md) says a lot more than having no notes at all. 

Just the fact that the note was created proves an interest to the subject and will helps to remember to things about it. 

So we shouldn't be ashamed of having very small notes, worst, empty notes. 

It's very similar to the anti-library concept where sleeping books in our library (meaning, #books/not-read) shouldn't make us feel guilty of not read it. These are here to say "here's the subjects you like, and if a certain moment, you need to refer to it, you know you have it". It's also better having a unread book about a subject we like rather than not having the book at all.
