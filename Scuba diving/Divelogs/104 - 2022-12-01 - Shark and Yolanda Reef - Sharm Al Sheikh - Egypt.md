# Summary
One of the most famous dive site in Egypt, and what a dive! We passed accross a drop of nearly 750m that was very impressive. Lots of different things to see, very rich and diverse. We started on the right of the plan, go to the middle of the dive in order to reach Yolanda wreck but had too much current to continue so we had to go backward. We didn't see any shark unfortunately.
