# Summary
First dive of a 10 dive journey in Epidaurus. My buddies needed to make a little refresh, so it was a little dive. 

The goal was the certification in marine biology (level 2). Every dive start with a briefing ([Dive planification for marine biology](Dive%20planification%20for%20marine%20biology.md)). We were expected to show to people species or scenes that present a remarquable thing to see (association, life scene, behavior, rare species...), took pictures and present it on the computer in the evening to the instructor.
