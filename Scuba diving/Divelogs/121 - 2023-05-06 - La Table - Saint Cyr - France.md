# Summary
2/2 dive for the drysuite certification training with Matteo. The goal was to confirm that I'm ready to dive in drysuit, test the weight and work on the fins. I dived with 7kg repartited on 2+2kg in the jacket and 3x1kg on the belt and it was perfect. Once I will be used to this suit, I will be able to dive with 6kg. 

I was diving with a tank that was 4kg apparent, 7kg weight, an SMB of something like 500g. So I was near 11kg of weight. 

The secondary goal was to perfect the trim in order to practice the frog kick and the helicopter turn. To get the perfect trim, it's all about weight repartition. With the drysuit, it's important to move some weight under the belt to weight the legs and achieve a better horizontality. Once we're perfectly at the horizontal, we just have to fold the legs and fin like a frog. That's the frog, it's more efficient than the scissors in terms of air consumption and hydrodynamics.
