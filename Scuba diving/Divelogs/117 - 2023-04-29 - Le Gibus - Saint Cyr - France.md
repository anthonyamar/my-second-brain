# Summary
First dive with Jennifer, and in Mediterranean sea with my camera gear. I already dive on those sites, so I knew the orientation and other things like this. But still discover new things, it's awesome.

Also, the first dive since I'm living in La Ciotat (south of France, at the sea). 
I started diving with 2+2kg in the stab, with the camera and was hell of too much weighted. I dropped all the weights at the start of the dive. With 0kg but the camera, I was well weighted, a bit light. The correct weight is 1+1kg on stab.
