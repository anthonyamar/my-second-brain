# Summary
First dive in a series of two rebreather initiation dives, using Shark rebreather. 

We first made the theory that had last close to an hour, then made a "dry dive", on earth, breathing into the machine in order to understand all the command, such as the O2 and diluant injection, the usage of the stab, how to quit and come back in the loop. We learn new signs specific to rebreather, like asking and telling your ppO2, making switch from the rebreather to the bail-out, cleaning the loop with pure O2 or diluant, finding your minimum volume... 

Once we made all of this, we'd go to dive and first made the security exercices and re-learn the basics :
- Learn a new check acronyme : GVI (Gaz, Volume, Instruments)
- Immerging (it's a bit different than open circuit, we need to inject air during the descent in the fake lungs)
- Find the minimum volume
- Stabilizing
- Quit the loop and go to the bail-out
- Quit the bail-out and come back to the loop

And then, go for a ride with the order to maintain our ppO2 at 1.0. 

It was very disturbing at first, as we don't have the ballast lung anymore, so stabilizing and buoyancy is very different than open circuit. Once we understood how to stabilize, inject and eject air from the fake lungs, it's becomming very interesting. 60 minutes dive without watching at the manometers one time. Awesome!
