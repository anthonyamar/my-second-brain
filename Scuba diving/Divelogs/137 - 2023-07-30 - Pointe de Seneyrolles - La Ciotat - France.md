# Summary
The site is near de Seneyrolles Calanque, on l'Île Verte. It start with rock tongues. And by following the rocks on the right hand, by palming for 10 minutes, we arrive on the Petit Moure site. 

Update: 
After this dive, I get a decompression sickness, that led me to the hospital. 
It's interesting to mention that even some of the most common dive profiles can lead to an accident. With an average of 13m, this is not a very saturating dive, but still, I got an accident. 

Not just right after the dive, but 4 hours after, due to an effort. I started to feel parasthesia in my right leg, so I called the emergency to have their opinion about that symptoma. It was really light, but they said it was important to be treated, so they get me at home and drives me to the hospital with an oxygen mask. 

Once in the hospital, in the hyperbaric service, they tested some of my reactions, asked me about my dives to understand what arrived, to choose the right decompression profile. I was put in a decompression chamber for 3h30 with 2h at 2.8atm and a very slow ascending of 1h30. 

They kept me for observations during the night, until the morning, without advising a second decompression profile. The decompression solved the problem with my leg, as it was a bubble of nitrogen that got stuck in the veins, by applying the same compression of my dive, the bubble was totally minimized, and evacuated using the 100% oxygen gas that I was breathing during the decompression process. 

It was very anxiety inducing to be stuck in that 3m2 capsule, with all those sounds of gas and working metal, but still an interesting experience.
