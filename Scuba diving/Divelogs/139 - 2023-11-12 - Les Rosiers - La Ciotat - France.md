# Summary
Get back with my camera, finaly! Famous site in La Ciotat, that is close to another site called "Levant". Levant is deeper, so I could not get to it. Some other divers saw a Mola Mola on Levant and told me that there's even a shoal of ~10 individuals close to another site in the bay. Hope I could saw some the next time I dive.
