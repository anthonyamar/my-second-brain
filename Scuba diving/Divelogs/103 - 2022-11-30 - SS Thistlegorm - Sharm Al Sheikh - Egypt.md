# Summary
On one of the most famous wreck of the world, very very very impressive boat! Too stressful for me, didn't make a second dive on it, I didn't liked that kind of dive. There was a strong current and it's difficult for a first time on a wreck like this to navigate and understand things, as the visibility is difficult, everything upside down, and the air is limited. I'll be back on it another time, with more experiences.
