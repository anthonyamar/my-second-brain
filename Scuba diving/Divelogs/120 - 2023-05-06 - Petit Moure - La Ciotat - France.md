# Summary
1/2 dive for the drysuite certification training with Matteo. So it wasn't very interesting in matter of biology, but very interesting as a technical dive. We aimed to find the correct weight using drysuit and made some exercices :
- Drysuit opened : descend until 5m with inflating to feel the pressure, then inflating to be just confort
- Go to 10m, feel the pressure, stabilized with the jacket, and starting an ascent to find how to correctly empty the air of the suit
- Go to 10m again, same exercice but stabilizing with the suit (simulate that the stab isn't working and use the suit as a redundant buoyancy tool)
- Go to 10m again, big inflating with closed suit, to see how it feels to be attracted by the surface by the feet, making a salto to be at the vertical and then open the suit and do the gesture to empty the suit
- Go until max depth site (17m) and make depth variations to understand what it feel with the suit. 

The difficulty was really on the feets and how to move the air from the feets, to the legs and the torso. 
I was really underweighted, so it was really difficult, until Matteo brings me new weights to stabilize my trim. 
The correct weight is 7kg repartited by 2+2 on the stab and 3x1 on the belt.
