# Summary
Cool site, fell great even if I think that I get a bit of [Nitrogen narcosis](Nitrogen%20narcosis.md) symptomas, but for maybe 1 or 2 minutes. Red gorgonians aren't in a great shape unfortunately, parasited by an algae that kill them. We had a really warm summer last year and a lot of them had died...
