## Level 3 in FFESSM
FFESSM means "Fédération Française d'Etude des Sports Sous Marins". 
It is our federation about sub-marine sports.

Levels go from 1 to 4. After the third one, it's more about supervising and teaching.
The licence is valid from 15 september to the 31 decembre of the next month, so 15 months. 

## Level 3
The level 3 is the combination of multiple sub-levels :
- PA40 : autonomous divers until 40m
- PA60 : autonomous divers until 60m
- PE60 : supervised divers until 60m

PA : Max 3 persons within an autonomous group of adult divers.
PE : Max 5 persons in the group : 4 divers + 1 superviser

This new level give us new responsability. In a dive group where people have less high levels, we're the ones who are responsible in case of accident. 

In PA, we can dive until 40m without a dive director, so we need to be autonomous on :
- Choose a dive site
- Have mandatory security assets on the boat
- Know how to drive a boat.

In this case, the sport legal frame always prevails and we're still subject to our prerogatives.

To validate this level, we need to make 10 dives in a natural environment and get the RIFAP licence (Réaction et Intervetion Face à un Accident de Plongée - react to dive accident), wich is 2 days of theoric and practice about security and first aid. 

## Mandatory equipment :
- Inflated gillet
- computer or table + deepmeter + watch
- Octopus
- At least one dive stop parachute in the group.
