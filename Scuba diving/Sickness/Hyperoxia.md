Hyperoxia is respiratory disease caused by oxygen toxicity. It occurs when the organism is exposed to an higher than normal [partial pressure](Partial%20pressure.md) of oxygen. 

Hyperoxia leads to two possible effects :
- The Lorrain Smith effect : pulmonary toxicity that can cause lung irritations.
- The Paul Bert effect : CNS (Nentral Nervous System) toxicity that cause symptoms similar to an epilepsy crisis. 

Oxygen toxicity is something to have in mind when using [Nitrox](Nitrox.md) or [hyperoxic trimix](Hyperoxic%20trimix.md) in [scuba diving](Scuba%20diving.md).
