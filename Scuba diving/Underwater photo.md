## Frame the photo 

1/3 and 2/3. The main subject subject shouldn't be at the center : 2/3 for the height and 2/3 of the width is preferable. (Golden number, Pythagoras...). 

In a fish, the most important things to see are the eyes and the mouth. Don't hesitate to get to the same level of the fish and lower yourself. 

Here some rules: 

- Privilege ascending mooves from descending ones
- 3/4 front profile
- Prefere ascending diagonal
- Shoal of fish going to the same direction
- Highlight the graphism, the texture and the matter.
- The photo need to tell a story.


### Flaws - don't: 
- ==Take from behind== there's no interest at all. It is better to wait or go around in order to take front or, at least, in profile
- Take from above
- Blur (due to lack of focus or movement)
- Unbind subject from the background
- Disturbing elements, such as other divers

### How to manage the dominant blue? 
Can be disturbing when it is tough on corals or fish, but less disturbing on landscapes like [Faults](Faults.md).

To manage the dominant blue:
- Understand that Infrared and red are leaving from 3-4m deep, then the orange is leaving
- Cameras have a "underwater mode"
- Choose the white balance
- External light will get back the red
- Good photograph placement compared to the light, especialy the sun.

By the way, a fish that we see red because we're lighten it up is in fact black. Underwater, it's camouflage color.

## Light
The sun should always be in your back to get better photos. 
Avoir toujours le soleil dans le dos pour une meilleure photo. 

If we use an external light, it should be :
- Max 5000 kelvin
- Dispersion between 70° and 100°
- Between 1500 to 2200 lumens
