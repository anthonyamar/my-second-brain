What really drives me to start [scuba diving](Scuba%20diving.md), is watching documentaries about diving. So, for the first time I dived, I had of course, took my GoPro. 

Well... The films taken this days wasn't what I expected at all. After ~40 dives, I'm still struggling making good underwater videos, but it wasn't my priority. I was focus on getting a good practice of scuba diving, so I can be fully autonomous, well stabilized, not feared or stress so I can focus on leveling up on my video skills. 

Here's the time! I just bought new gear : #GoPro Hero 9 with deep dive case, underwater light and I'm really well decided to improve my skills and make great videos. 

[Making great videos](Make%20great%20videos.md) isn't about gear (even if it play its role), it's also about composition, what to film and how to edit the video (in [Premiere Pro](Premiere%20Pro.md) e.g). 

So here's a collection of tips and links, most of them, are GoPro specific. 

## Hint 
The time for interesting videos should be between 30 seconds and 2 minutes. 

Don't forget to have the screen active along the dive and to lock the screen orientation in landscape (GoPro).

Film with outstreched arms, making very slow moves, pointing on the subject right at the first image.

To have a better edit flexibility in post-production, film at least in 2.7k and 120 fps. Using the GoPro Hero 9, activate the boost stabilisation, high debit, ISO max 1500 (to be adjusted depending on the sun luminosity and the max operating depth. The deeper, the higher ISO, because less light).
