,As an autonomous diver, we need to communicate with our buddy and planificate the dive. Here's what to ask.

Aptitudes :
- How do you consume your air?
- Ears sensibility?
- Cold sensibility?

Gear :
- Do you have the base equipment? (decompression stop parachute?)
- Does your computer put deep decompression stop? How it is settled? 
- Do you have any light?
- Any submersible shelf?

Global dive :
- Set a max depth time and a take-off pressure
- Max operating depth
- How fast the group will evolve?
- Is it your first or second dive of the day? (for decompression)
- Remind the gestures to communicate
