The more time we take to go to our floor depth, the more we'll stay at diverse depth, and thus, the more we saturate.

By going down straight to the max operating depth, the dive profile is more favorable from the point of view of saturation. This avoids spending time at each depth and saturate at each level to then ascend and doing big decompression stop. 

This is what we call a square dive.
