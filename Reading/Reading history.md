History books will highlight facts and events on specific dates that happened in the past, they're *“chronotopics”*. 

History books, should be read syntopicaly, meaning that, for a specific period, we should read multiple and different events of its kind. It's also important to learn not just what happened, but also how people were living and acting of that period of time. 

History suggests the possible by describing what have be done. The questions to ask are more: 
- How this started?
- How this could be done?
- Is this could be done again?
- How this could be avoided?

History, in that sense, is preventing things, behaviors and mostly events. Preventing from being reproduced as well as to reproduce, in case of favorable events.
