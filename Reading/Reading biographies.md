Biographies are stories about one's living. There's different kind of biographies, mostly different in their degress of truth. There's no biography that highlight all the things and events in one's life with an absolute truth. Thus, we need to ask ourselves what the author's intentions are. 

Also, if we really want the "truth", we have to read multiple biographies as well as autobiography if one was written.
