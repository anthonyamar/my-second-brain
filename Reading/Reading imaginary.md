As we may suggest, [Reading technics should differ depending on book type](Reading%20technics%20should%20differ%20depending%20on%20book%20type.md). In order to achieve a great [Analytical reading](Analytical%20reading.md), each style should be treated differently. Here's how we should treat imaginary reading.

There are three groups of rules for imaginary reading: structural, interpretative and cultural.

**Structural:**
- Classify according to its kind
- Grasp the unity of the whole book
- Reduce the whole to its simple unity and show how it is constructed

**Interpretative:**
- Become familiar with the characters
- Become at home in this imaginary
- Follow the story rhythm and naration 

**Cultural:**
- Don't criticize until you fully appreciate what the author has tried to make you experience

Some imaginary books have underlying purposes, such as attacks against totalitarianism in [1984 - George Orwell](1984%20-%20George%20Orwell.md) and [Animal Farm - Georges Orwell](Animal%20Farm%20-%20Georges%20Orwell.md). That's one of the things we should find while reading the book. 

## On reading speed

Contrary to plays, especialy Shakespear's ones, that should be read slowly as if the audience were listening, stories should be read fast, with the least pauses. This help to keep a good picture of the whole book and better understand the dynamics between the characters. 

Even if we read fast, we might read at constant speed in order to keep the focus and the history thread. The reading focus will be more on the syntax, the vocabulary, and the emotions that the author wants to give. 

Details don't matter that much in the story's comprehension, also because stories are existing only in the frame of the book. Once we finish it, we will no longer have interactions with the characters, hence the non-necessity of diving that deep in the details. 

As novels are very descriptive, I'll not be choked to learn that the brain is calling the visual cortex way more than the part of the brain that connects concepts and ideas, maybe more used for non-fiction book. 

## Dramas, plays and lyrical poems

Dramas, plays and lyrical poems should be read "out loud", as they're mostly oratory art. Just like stories, we shouldn't make pauses (the least possible).

Reading poems is a lifetime job: interpretating and understanding the keywords require and deserves many visits to the text.
