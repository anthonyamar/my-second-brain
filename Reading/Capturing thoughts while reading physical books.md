Capturing thoughts and references to achieve [Litterature note](Litterature%20note%20to%20quote%20and%20reference%20content.md) can sometimes be a bit cumbersome and requires a bit of reflexion. I recently watched a video from Tiago Forte where he gave his technic on note taking in books that I found interesting. I tested it and seems to be really appropriate to [Digital garden](Digital%20garden.md) through [Zettelkasten](The%20zettelkasten%20method%20and%20how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes.md).

It consist of recreating our own table of contents at the beginning of a book, by referencing ideas and highlighted through our reading with the purpose of later be transformated in notes during the reformulate of ideas ([202106122244 Reformulating ideas enlarge our set of thinking tools](202106122244%20Reformulating%20ideas%20enlarge%20our%20set%20of%20thinking%20tools.md)).

For this, I just use the first blank page and write with a pencil the incremented ID and the page of the reference with a title. At the end of the book, I can refer to it to find subjects and ideas that inspired me.
