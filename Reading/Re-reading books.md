## Should we re-read books?

We all had experienced this feeling: we finish a book, and come back randomly later (months or years...) and feel like we didn't read it the way we should and that we didn't really learn from it neither, because we merely remember the key concepts or reading things like it's the first time. So the question is, should we re-read books? Is it worth it, or should we just move forward with new books?

Even though it could seem counterintuitive, if you feel like you missed something important or if you just liked it so much that you think you can still learn things from it, it would be worth re-reading the book. But not necessarily the same way.

We should be super selective about what re-reading (and what we're reading to be said). Selective about the book, but also what to read in the book. This is why technics like [Inspectional reading](Inspectional%20reading.md) are great for re-reading books: we can just inspect the book to force remembering things and select the parts we want to give deeper interests. We don't have to read every book front to back, treating it like study material can be equally effective. This what we're achieving by doing inspectional reading on book we already read.

We could also prepare re-reading while reading by outlining topics we're sure we'll want to dive in later, right after finishing a book. This state the importance of taking [Smart notes](The%20zettelkasten%20method%20and%20how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes.md) during a book, because it also reduces the need of re-reading a book or do the selective job for ourselves.
