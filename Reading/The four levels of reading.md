As described in [How To Read A Book, The Classic Guide To Intelligent Reading - Mortimer J. Adler, Charles Van Doren](How%20To%20Read%20A%20Book,%20The%20Classic%20Guide%20To%20Intelligent%20Reading%20-%20Mortimer%20J.%20Adler,%20Charles%20Van%20Doren.md), reading isn't a passive activity at all, [there's various level of active reading](202106242157%20There's%20various%20level%20of%20active%20reading.md):

1. [Elementary reading](Elementary%20reading.md). It's the basic level where ones simply read and get the sense of sentences. This is the level on which elementary students are. 
2. [Inspectional reading](Inspectional%20reading.md). It is the best reading technic for ones with a limited amount of reading time. As the name suggest, we're inspecting a book with a specific procedure in order to get the most of the book. It englobes technics like surface reading and always start by an overview of the book.
3.  Analytical reading. This is the best technic for ones who want to understand a book with an unlimited time available. Reading with this technic is very demanding in yes kf focus and require a kind of roadmap, like questions to asks, finding keywords, key arguments and sentences etc.
4.  Syntopical reading. It is the highest level of reading and concerns mostly comparing many books on the same topics together, in order to see far beyond. It comes with the ability to construct analysis that are not in the books. 

Reading levels are cumulative, meaning that, we need to “master” one before going to the next level. Each reading phase brings us closer to a true mastery of reading as an art. Like other skills, reading as an art need practice and [will become an habit](Adopting%20new%20habits.md).
