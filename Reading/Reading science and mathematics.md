Sciences book will mostly search for truth rather than describing things that happened, just like philosophy ([Reading philosophy](Reading%20philosophy.md)). They both search for truth, but not the same way, nor will answer questions the with the same arguments. Science is more about observations on results brought by experiences and empircal discoveries. Philosophical books take more on reflexions and common sense to answer the questions, in a more "theorical" and abstract way. 

Science and mathematics, unlike history, aren't chronotopic. While being in [Analytical reading](Analytical%20reading.md) phase, we should search for deductive arguments, specific vocabulary and its meaning, as as well as facts and [Axioms](Axioms.md). 

Everyone has to learn his/her language twice: to speak it and then, to read it ([Elementary reading](Elementary%20reading.md)). As mathematic is a language, we should first start to clear and succeed reaching the elementary level to really go to the next levels of comprehension. 

If our intention is to read a mathematic book for itself, we should read it carefully, taking the time to read formulas, in its entirety with a pen in hand and a sketchbook. 

If we just want to read a scientific work that has mathematics and science in it, we better have to skip symbols and equestions. The aim isn't to become competent in the subject but instead to understand the problem. 

When it comes to social sciences, the most important question to answer is what type of book it is (according to [Inspectional reading](Inspectional%20reading.md)). Because social science pick up from a bunch of different materials and subjects, as well as a lot of sub-matters.
