There's some case where [Analytical reading](Analytical%20reading.md) can't be applied and reading news is one of these. To better understand a news and reading it well, we need to ask questions that are a bit similar to the [Inspectional reading](Inspectional%20reading.md) ones: 
- What does the author want to prove?
- Who does he/she want to convince?
- What special knowledge does he/she assume?
- What special language does he use?
- Does he/she really know what he/she's talking about?
- What are the author's or media's natural position and beliefs? (This assumes that objectivity doesn't exist in medias).
