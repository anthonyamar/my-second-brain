## Why evaluating a book? 

Evaluating a book, before, during and after finishing it, is a way to get way more from it. This force us to think deeper about what it was, what we learned, what do we want to (and will) remember and improve our reading and comprehensive skills. 

## How to evaluate a book? 

[Reading technics should differ depending on book type](Reading%20technics%20should%20differ%20depending%20on%20book%20type.md), so the evaluation will also differ. But there's various things we can do that are independant from the book type:

- Summarizing the entire book with a single sentence or a short paragraph by extracting the substantive marrow from it and explain how each part are connected to create a consistant book. This exerce our abstraction ability. 
- Outlining the book in our own word, better/tougher than the author's one. Some could be quoted, but we should mostly reformulate and complete the outline with short summary of what we understood and what had been said in each chapter. This will help memorizing and will act as a great start point of [Re-reading books](Re-reading%20books.md).
