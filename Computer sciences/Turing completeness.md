One of the most popular terms when working around [programming language creation](Create%20a%20programming%20language.md) is the concept of Turing completeness.

In simple terms, to be called "Turing complete", a given language must have the ability to do anything that a [Turing machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLVCscCY4xI) can do.

Basically, a very large amount of modern programming languages are Turing complete. They're all able to run any kind of program and solve any computation problems that a Turing machine can run given enough time and memory.
