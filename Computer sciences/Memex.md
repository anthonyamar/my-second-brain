The Memex is an hypothetical machine drafted by Vannevar Bush in his 1945 article "As We May Think". 

The Memex is a device that can store and compress all of one's books, records, and communications and that could give the user, the ability to consult with exceeding speed and flexibility making it “an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory”. 

Early hypertext systems, World Wide Web and PKM softwares or methods like [Digital garden](Digital%20garden.md) were influenced, delibarately or not, by the Memex concept.
