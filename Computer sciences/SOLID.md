The SOLID acronym is something we tend to hear a lot about in [Oriented Object Programming](Oriented%20Object%20Programming.md) (OOP). It's a mnemonic acronyme that list 5 design concepts intended to make software designs more understadable, flexible, maintainable and scalable.

The 5 principles are : 
- Single-responsability principle
- Open-closed principle
- Liskov substitution principle
- Interface segregation principle
- Dependency inversion principle
