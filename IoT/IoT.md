I discoverd IoT (Internet of Things) when I was trying to found [my actual startup](https://www.studiomatic.co/en). The idea was to create full automated music studios that you can book and access with your smartphone, 24h/7d. 

As I wasn't familiar with tech at all at this time (I was a guitar teacher and pro musician), I had to learn a lot on technologies, espcially on IoT. I have still a lot of things to learn from this broad subject, but I can say that I worked a lot on it. I'm now even teaching it for MBAs and master degrees. Who would have believed it? ðŸ˜Š

So here's some of my thoughts, lists, links, notes and course preparations on #IoT.
