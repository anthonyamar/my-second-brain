I personnaly fell in the IoT field with smartlock and the first device I bought was a Nuki Smartlock 2.0. It has made me understand how smart devices works and allowed me to explore a new way of making business. It's now the main assets of my company : we're using Smartlock to provide 24h/7d access to music studios with a smartphone.
