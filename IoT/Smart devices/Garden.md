### ðŸŒ± Garden

Garden related smart device are one of a kind. You can, just like the vacuum robot, have mower robots which can mow the lawn while you're having fun or working, but also use smart device that helps you to grow your own food with a better efficiency indoor and outdoor. FarmBot, quoted below, is for me one of the most impressive application of IoT in the garden field.
