### ðŸ”‘ Locks

Smartlocks gain more and more popularity because of the confort and the security they're providing, but also since people understood the pain of managing Airbnb houses. These device allow user to get rid of their keys, or remotely provide access to friends, family, tenants or delivery wo.mans. 

I personnaly fell in the [IoT](IoT.md) field with smartlock and the first device I bought was a Nuki Smartlock 2.0. It has made me understand how smart devices works and allowed me to explore a new way of making business. It's now the main assets of my company : we're using Smartlock to provide 24h/7d access to music studios with a smartphone. That's also what IoT devices can do : let entrepreneurs explore new #business-model and create disrupting products.
