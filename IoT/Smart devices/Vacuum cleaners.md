### ðŸ§¹ Vacuum cleaners

Who like to vacuum seriously? I know that some people are seing [mindfuleness in everyday chores](https://tinybuddha.com/blog/mindfulness-in-everyday-tasks-5-ways-chores-can-make-you-happier/), but this is unfortunately not the majority of the population. Vacuum robots were invented for those who hate to vacumm. You can schedule your vacuum to start it chores when you're at work in example, so you can come back in a cleaned home.
