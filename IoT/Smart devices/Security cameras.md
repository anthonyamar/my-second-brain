### ðŸ“¹ Security cameras

Security cameras are now more afforadable than ever. These can meet basic needs such as providing a video stream of your home on your smartphone but can also do more to improve both confort and security. Thanks to #artificial-intelligence and face recognition, cameras can i.e., start scenarios when you enter your home and the camera detect your face. You don't even have to do anything : the camera recognize you, unlock your door, light up your house, and launch the coffee machine.
