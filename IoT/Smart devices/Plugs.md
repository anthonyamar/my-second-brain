Smart plugs are one of most useful and easy to setup devices. You just plug it on your regular plug, connect it to Wi-Fi, and you're now able to control it from your phone. Like this, you can just control everything that wasn't supposed to be smart, like your beloved floor lamp or any other device. Some of them are also providing useful informations such as your electric consumption. These are great starts if you want to cut your bills.
