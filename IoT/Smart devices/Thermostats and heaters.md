### ðŸŒ¡ Thermostats and heaters

Smart thermostats are some of the device that can really make the change on your energy bills. Theses devices allow users to remotely control temperature in rooms and schedule different configurations. You can i.e., stop heaters when you're not at home and ask the device to get to your desired temperature when you're coming back at home. This can be a huge economy.
