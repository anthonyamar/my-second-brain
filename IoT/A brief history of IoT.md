# What is IoT ? 

The #IoT refer as the Internet of Things, which, according to Wikipedia ==describes the network of physical objects -"things"- that are embedded with sensors, software and orther technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet==. 

When talking about IoT, we often talk about smart objects, or wearable. IoT, just like #internet, #artificial-intelligence or #blockchain, is a general purpose technology. Which means it can be used in a lot of context and have various utility. 

The history of IoT (Internet of Things) is very related to the [the computer history](A%20brief%20computer%20history.md). We can't talk about IoT without talking of the objects itself, which are mainly computers related.
