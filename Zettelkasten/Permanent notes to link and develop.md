The permanent notes are, in my opinion, the most important kind of notes in the [The zettelkasten method and how to take smart notes](The%20zettelkasten%20method%20and%20how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes.md) taking process. 

They aim to connect [Fleeting notes](Fleeting%20notes%20to%20capture%20thoughts.md) and [Litterature notes](Litterature%20note%20to%20quote%20and%20reference%20content.md) together to create new ideas and new questions. 

Better to be once a day : going through the inbox to review all the captured materials and connect things that can be connected together. 

The permanent will then be added to the slipbox, where it will be archived and tagged. These will then be connected together to create bigger materials that could end up becoming posts, papers or even books. In exemple, my [Digital garden](Digital%20garden.md) is my slipbox so far. 

Like said in [[Atomic design applied to digital gardening]], fleeting and litterature notes are like atoms that are combined to create mollecules : permanent notes. Permanent notes will then be combined and linked in order to create organisms.

Permanent notes should be written as if it will be publicly read. Just like [Writting is the only thing that count](Writting%20is%20the%20only%20thing%20that%20count.md), making public notes matter because it force to write things down in order to be read. This need to read with the aim of understanding deeper the treated subject. This is very close to the *"Learning in public*" principle describe by Maggie Appleton in [her article "A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden"](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) about [Digital garden](Digital%20garden.md)
