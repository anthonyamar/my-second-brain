It's refreshing to question basic everyday acts like taking notes. When I started [digital gardening](Digital%20garden.md), I discover a whole world around note taking : zettelkasten, [Evergreen notes](Evergreen%20notes.md), smart notes, #second-brain... and a lot of vocubulary and technics about how to make your notes work for you rather than the other way around. 

The term "Smart note" can be attributed to Sönke Ahrens and his book [How To Take Smart Notes](How%20To%20Take%20Smart%20Notes%20-%20Sönke%20Ahrens.md), where he describe a system inspired by Niklas Luhmann (well known for his fabulous productivity, *wrote more than 70 books and 400 scholarly articles in his life*, and note system called zettelkasten) that allow students, academics and nonfiction book writers to boost their writing, learning and thinking skill. 

The goal is to create a system on which we can rely on, to externalize our thoughts using specifics notes that aim to be connected together in order to create new ideas. 

This is super useful for people who need to write papers, blog posts, books or anything like this. Rather than putting a lot of effort for each new subject that we address in research, assembling a strong note system based on simple and atomics notes taken along the way help a lot and save a tremendous amount of time while skyrocketing productivity. 

I like how he describe the process and the transformation of ideas into valuable assets :
1.  [[Fleeting notes to capture thoughts]]
2. [[Litterature note to quote and reference content]]
3. [[Permanent notes to link and develop]]
4. Adding permanent notes to the Slipbox


There's more steps after this that are here to shape and arrange newly created ideas to create a well standing academic paper or book. These four are for me the real game changer and the principle of zettelkasten
