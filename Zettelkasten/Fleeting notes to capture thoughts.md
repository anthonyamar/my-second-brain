Fleeting notes are the first element in the process of making [The zettelkasten method and how to take smart notes](The%20zettelkasten%20method%20and%20how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes.md). 

The goal of fleeting notes are to capture thoughts on the go, using any capture method. In a [Zettelkasten](The%20zettelkasten%20method%20and%20how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes.md) note taking method, the fleeting note is going into the inbox, where it will be processed. 

This step can be skipped if the idea is already processed and shaped.

Here's the specs :
- Fleeting notes need to be absolutely painless, short and spontaneous. It's just a starting point for growing a new idea and a reminder of thoughts you couldn't processed yet. 
- Fleeting notes aim to be deleted within the 2 or 3 days once they were written. Though, they must be deleted especialy if you can't recall the context anymore, make no sense or became banal. 
- Fleeting note don't need to be written with destination or purpose. The usage and the purpose of a fleeting note can and will be decide later, once it will become a [Permanent note](Permanent%20notes%20to%20link%20and%20develop.md)
- Fleeting notes has to be reviewed everyday. This is an habit to take in order to have a performant zettelkasten system. By reviewed, I mean tagged, processed, reformulated and connected to [Litterature note](Litterature%20note%20to%20quote%20and%20reference%20content.md) in order to create [Permanent note](Permanent%20notes%20to%20link%20and%20develop.md).
- Fleeting notes must all be formatted the same to be reviewed easier : [Software design principles applied to digital gardening](Software%20design%20principles%20applied%20to%20digital%20gardening.md). It's common to add a timestamp at title note's beginning in order to store it chronologically, i.e., 202105122231 (YYYYMMDDhhmm).

Taking fleeting notes can be done using various mediums. Niklas Luhmann was writting his on both sides of a paper card.  It doesn't need to be only on paper though. We can take fleeting notes using note taking apps, voice recording, bookmarks, emails and paper. 

The more different medium you have, the more consistency you'll need to process everything with the least restraint possible. 

[My productivity tools](My%20productivity%20tools.md) on this are :
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) for note taking. I have three folders that follow the [Zettelkasten](The%20zettelkasten%20method%20and%20how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes.md) principles on a private vault, including a Fleeting note folder where I collect thoughts on the go. Obsidian allow vocal notes, which is even better
- [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/) for bookmarking. I like Raindrop as it can bookmark more than link but also because finding back links are never been that easy. Like any other productivity software, it need a bit of efforts to adapt your workflow, but this worth the efforts. There's a lot of progress margin with this tool as it can work with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) and make automated workflow.
