Litterature notes are the second process in [The zettelkasten method and how to take smart notes](The%20zettelkasten%20method%20and%20how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes.md) method. 

These note aim to help remember an idea that triggered an interest. It's really about the content. 

The litterature notes goes to the reference system ([Zettelkasten](The%20zettelkasten%20method%20and%20how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes.md) methodology) and will act as note you can refer to. 

Litterature notes must be reformulated rather than strictly quoted in order to be valuable and reminded. This help extracting the essence while forcing memorization. If we can't fully reformulate, taking brief account are still better than collecting a lot of quotes.

It will be cumulated and connected with [Fleeting notes](Fleeting%20notes%20to%20capture%20thoughts.md) in order to create [Permanent notes](Permanent%20notes%20to%20link%20and%20develop.md)

As it's litterature and content, it's a great thing to consider quoting everytime the source. It will help better referencing sources when writting a definitive paper.
