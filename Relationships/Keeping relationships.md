Keeping relationships may take some time, but everything start with an intention: have genuine words for people, ask some news and remember things that are important for them such as their current life goal, projects, dreams, work, travels, hobbies...

Try to take news quite often and keep up with people you like. Even if there are no actions, there are stil intentions. 

This could be objectived and built as an [Habit](Adopting%20new%20habits.md): take news of two different people per week, for example. Start by just genuinely asking news about the person and propose to hang out often, take a coffee or just going for a walk.
