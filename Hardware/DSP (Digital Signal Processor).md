DSP stands for Digital Signal Processor and is a specialized microprocessor chip optimized for digital signal processing such as audio, video, sensors... 

It is often use in [audio interfaces](Audio%20interface.md) to free up CPU and immprove the system stability. By delegating CPU intensive operation on analog audio to the DSP chip, the computer's CPU is free to dedicate more resource on other operations. One of the notable effect is that it reduce a lot the latency on recording.  

[[ARM (Advanced RISC Machines)]] can be extended with DSP to increase efficiency and reduce complexity of ARM processors.
