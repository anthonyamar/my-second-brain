## What are evergreen notes? 
Seems to be first described by [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/), Evergreen notes are said to be ==fundamental unit of knowledge work==.

The concept draws its origins from the [Zettelkasten](The%20zettelkasten%20method%20and%20how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes.md) method and is a way to achieve a better note-taking practice and leverage more from your notes than the typical anarchic way of note taking (hear: accumulating notes with no purpose, called *"transient notes"*). 

==Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve over time==, hence the name *"evergreen"* and follow design principles (see [Software design principles applied to digital gardening](Software%20design%20principles%20applied%20to%20digital%20gardening.md) i.e):
- **Atomicity**: notes should be atomic to allow reuse
- **Concept-orientation**: notes should be around concepts and big ideas rather than specific things (books, articles, medias...)
- **High density linking**: notes should be densely connected to other to create better and organic associations rather than strict hierarchical structures. 
- **Focus on your own ideas rather than others' ideas**: notes should be about your own idea and way to think about the concept you're writing, rather than a collection of references from books or citations

I'll kindly add these other concept that I think relevant:
- **Personnalisation**: ==notes should be optimised== for you rather than for a specific audience or target (but still presentable to a foreign reader)
- **Medium diversity**: ==notes should be filled with diverse mediums==, like images, audio, video, books, articles, illlustrations, websites, links etc... 
- **Open-ended**: it's the key principle behind evergreen concept, notes should always be open to extensions

I like how [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/) illustrated it (from her article Growing the Evergreens)
