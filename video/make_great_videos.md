Notes on how to make great YouTube videos

## Gear

Use a great camera in which you can at least edit ISO, colors, focus and have a great image quality.

## Lights

Use lights in a way that it can light up your face from different angle. We can stick paper on the light to create a kind of diffusor. Avoid being against the light or counterbalance with more light on your face.

## Audio

Use a great microphone to have a good audio quality. Audio is about 50% of the video experience. So bad video with a great audio is still better than good video but bad audio. Clipping mics for $20 exists and are a great way to start. You can also, for a better micing, buy an audio interface and a static microphone or even just a Zoom field recording.

## Camera position

When you're shooting your video, start setting up the frame with a 3x3 squares and go into the middle, your head in the two

## Editing the video

Based on : [Video Editing Tricks for YouTubers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKStCpi3-Oo)

### 1. Cropping

Use a large frame to allow you cropping video and create the illusion of having multiple cameras and creating more dynamic content.

### 2. Adding content with layers

Add text to illustrate words and thoughts or image.

You can even use photo, but make sure to edit it with the Ken Burns Effect, which is having an image and moving slowly in to create the illusion of a video by panning or zooming in.

### 3. Record clips instead of big long footages

By recording shorts clip, you are more agile in the process of making your video. You can just preview clip separatly and stick them together to create a more consistent video. It allow you to also rearrange the content easily to make the development more natural

### 4. Use template every time

To edit faster, create template with your favorite window arrangement, tracks and videos settings, folders with your favorites songs, effects and images to gain in workflow productivity and improve consistency across your videos

Don't need to do fancy things, just improve the colors by adding a little bit of contrast and a little bit of saturation can improve the image. Automatic color correction plugins for video are also very valuable.

### 5. Plan your content

Refer to the script your video chapter above. Scripting and planing your content will allow you to edit faster and know what to keep and what to trash. It also help you to know when you need to cut the cam to create meaningful clips.

### 6. Take help of the sound waveform to make the right cuts

Using the audio waveform will help you to discern and decide faster where to cut to shorten sequences and add a better rythm to your video.

### 7. Have enough footage to choose

It's better to have more clips than not enough clips so you can make the right choice and have a more natural and dynamic video. You can achieve that by shooting the each sequence 2 or 3 times and trying to have different intonation, position, words etc, to create the best video composition when editing.
