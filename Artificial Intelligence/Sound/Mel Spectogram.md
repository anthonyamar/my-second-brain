The Mel Spectogram is a 3D representation of the sound. It has the time in abscissa axis, the frequency in Hz on the orderly axis and the third dimension the volume in dB,  represented with a color spectrum from black (-âˆž dB) to yellow/white (+0 dB). 

This representation is widely used for [sound classification](Sound%20classification.md) by applying image recognition patterns with #machine-learning and #deep-learning algorithms.
