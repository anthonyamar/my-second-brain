The osmosis is the process of gradual or unconscious assimilation of ideas, knowledge etc. We can talk about osmosis for someone who weren't convinced of a specific idea at all, but change his view gradualy and unconsciously, or just for learning in general. 

Ideas aren't perfect from the begining. We're progressing on some ideas or on learning some new things not only with efforts, but also unconsciously. Sleeping promote osmosis i.e., just like doing everyday things, like walking or taking bath can also promote osmosis, until a bigger idea comes up. Thinking about Archimedes in his bath or Descartes when jumping in the tramway, both expercienced a kind of osmosis that ended up with paradigm shifting ideas.
