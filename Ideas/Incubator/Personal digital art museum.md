## What is digital art?

I recently discovered #digital-art as financial assets through #NFT ([Non-fungible token](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)) in an #investments newsletter. I liked the concept a lot and appear to me as the most concrete application of #blockchain in art so far. 

Digital art marketplace has emerged, allowing art fans, collectors and investors to buy piece of art with a cotation that can rise (or fall) and have the certainty of his ownership and authenticity thanks to non fungible tokens, #smart-contract and #Ethereum blockchain. 

According to [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-are-nft), NFTs are stored in compatbile digital asset wallets. As most of the NFTs are created on Ethereum, the most popular choice is with [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/), which is also compatible with hardware wallets such as Ledger. 

## Exhib your digital art collection on your walls.

Digital arts aren't the kind of art you can watch to everyday as you would star at your favorite painting hooked on your wall. 

The idea behind the personal digital art museum is to give the ability to collectors to put exhib their digital goods on their wall. Not physicaly, but virtualy, using [augmented reality](Augmented%20reality.md). 

By sticking a trigger sign on a wall, such as a QR code i.e., a user could flash it using the appropriate app and see the piece come to live, thanks to augmented reality. 

The collector could just connect his NFT wallet to the app and assign a piece to a unique trigger sign, print it and hook it wherever he want on his wall and arrange his arts just like an exhibition curator would design an exhibition.

With this, the collector could enjoy his/her art pieces as well as his/her guest could discover the collection just by opening the camera mode on their phone.

## SaaS and transaction fees business model

This could have at least two business models: 
1. **SaaS model subscription** : based on the number of pieces owned. First plan could start at 5 unique trigger but unlimited rotating of art on theses 5 trigger. Other plan could benefit from exclusive features listed below and unlimited unique triggers. 
2. **Transaction fee** : By creating kind of exhibitions, we could also digitalize the associated business model which is a transaction fee when a piece of art is selled. Just like an exhibition, when flashing the trigger, you could have information about the artwork as well as the price. Here, we could give the ability to buy it directly from the smartphone. 

## Features

### Art informations
Display artwork informations such as description, the artist profile, artwork origin, previous acquisitions, last acquisition date, current owner profile, price, verification token for authenticity proof and so on. 

### Buy this art CTA
Reveal a "buy" button with the price on pieces that owner is ok to sell. This could put the exhibition business model at a very large scale by removing trusted intermediary (the blockchain promise in short). The app would take a fee on transaction but would be in charge of the NFT transfert from the owner to the buyer wallet. This will democratize exhibition organization and allow buy and sell between friends during physical events. 

### Temporary collections
Create time delimited art/trigger association to create temporary exhibitions with automatic shift. By categorizing, we could i.e., create a set with 3D as a theme, set it for a month and wait for the automatic shift, revealing a new set on a different theme. 

### Private exhibitions with ticketing system. 
Sell tickets for your exhibitions : only the people with the appropriate ticket could see the art on their phone. Tickets could be selled directly from the app, just like Eventbrite, but with tickets that carry authorizations tokens to display or not the art. By using this, we could organize private exhibitions on public spaces. 

### Rent this art CTA
Same as the buy button, but with a rent system : rent a piece of art for a determined time frame to hook at your home for specific events. The art owner could determinate a per period payment on wich the app would process a transaction fee for transfering the piece back and forth between the two wallets and creating a smart contract. 

### Place a bid CTA
Same as the buy or rent button, but with bids. A visitor could place a bid on auctioned pieces. The auction and/or the bid could be time limited. Just like eBay, but for digital arts in physical events.
