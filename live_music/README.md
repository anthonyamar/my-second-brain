# Live music

Live is music is part of my life, as a musician and also as a CEO of a music tech company. I want to keep track of some concert hall and live music places, so I can benchmark, create partnerships or even transform it as a booking tool.

As we're opening studios with Studiomatic everywhere in France, having lists of music places also helps us to understand the musical cultures of each cities. The concert agenda of local scenes says a lot about the culture and the music at a local level as we can see which styles of music predominate or lack. Theses are useful market informations.
