- I'm largely refactoring my [Books and Binders](Books%20and%20Binders.md) software to better handle my needs on Obsidian, so I update all the notes in the `Library/` folder (+270 ðŸ˜…) with hidden comments that act as a DSL (Domain Specific Language). So there's no big changes, except maybe some fixed typos, but this prepares something very big!
- I extend and illustrate my note on [Bryozoa (ectoprocta)](Bryozoa%20(ectoprocta).md)
- Add the [Cloudinary auto-upload](https://github.com/jordanhandy/obsidian-cloudinary-uploader) plugin to my vault in order to run tests for the next project I have: Use Obsidian to log my dives and the species I meet and photograph, to act as a kind of naturalism and learn about my learning biology.
