# Improved
- Radically improve the #marine-species folder by following a simpler classification, but subdivide with better folder granularity. I first created this folder tree as a template that I just duplicate and put on my iPad before every dive travel to fasten the sorting of underwater pictures. 
- Precise conservation status on [Diploria sp. - Grooved brain coral](Diploria%20sp.%20-%20Grooved%20brain%20coral.md)
- For each embranchment, add an `Ω Incertae Sedis` folder to store the unknown species. 
- Add a new specie in [Alcyoniidae sp.](Alcyoniidae%20sp..md), the leather coral. 
- Revamp [Heteractis magnifica - Magnificent sea anemone](Heteractis%20magnifica%20-%20Magnificent%20sea%20anemone.md) to better fit in the folder, by adding the classification tree. 

# Deleted
- Remove all the rarest phylum that was before created through a note and that I will not see through diving because too difficult to find.
