## Investing in state controlled saving plans

In France, we have what we call the "Livret A", which is a paid account everyone can open and where the rate is controled by the gouvernment. Right now, it's at 0,5%, let's say it : nearly nothing. I'm using this kind of saving just to put my [emergency fund](Emergency%20fund.md), so it can make me earn a little every year but I don't expect anything from it. 

Any saving plan which isn't remunerate more than the inflation rate should be totally avoided for long term saving. As the inflation is controlled by central banks at a mean of 2%, saving on a "Livret A" for an extented period of time is litteraly losing money. 

With better remuneration, in France, there's also the ["LEP, Livret d'épargne populaire",](https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F2367) which is at 1%, but ceiled to 7700€ in total...
