## Investing in old books

[Collecting old books](Collecting%20old%20books.md)  was one of the first investment I'd commit to. I mostly bought books between 100€ and 250€ in mint condition so they can take value. 

One of the good point is that it's a non normative market, that means you can buy a book a day and selling it twice the price the next day just because there's no official cotation (at least on low prices books < 500€), so it's just by the appreciation of the buyer and his knowledge about books. And a lot of people are buying book on a crush, less with a profit based intuition.

I consider this activity as a long term investment, with low value and profit over time,  low risk activity but a very pleasant investment, because you can enjoy it as a book, a piece of art and/or a part of the history. It's more tied to a passion than a real investment for profit, but still : the books are taking value accross time. 

Talking about risk : you can easily sell a book the same price you bought it if you're patient enough, wether it's on eBay or to a bookshop. But, as it's a physical object, the risk of losing it in fire, flood or any other disaster like this is something to have in mind. Another real threat for books is the arrival of termites. It's still very rare, but if you're living near forests and you're sometimes hiking, you'll more likely to pay attention to this.
