## Investing in real estate

The long term investment at his best. Just like stock market trading, real estate investment has its share of wrong popular belief : out of buying your principal residence, it's for rich people. It's expansive. Bank don't borrow easily. Rates are too high right now and so on... 

I learned, again, that everything depends on your investment strategy and what you want to achieve. Personnaly, I'm doing it to make profit or at least, not making financial efforts, so I'm clearly not buying my principal residence even not my second residence.

I'll buy my first real estate this year, with my brother and my father. It's an appartement near the mediterean sea, and we make it clear first about the strategy : the appartement need to be 100% financed by the fruit of rental.

This choice by its own shapped the way I'm seeing and investing in real estate : I'm more data driven about what to buy, how to buy, how to sell/rent it, the kind of loan I get from the bank etc.

It's interesting to see how things that were seen as completely out of scope to me before are now something totally doable, just by seeing it from a different point of view. 

That's probably the most important thing I learned while by starting investment : it depends a lot on your investement thesis : risk level, outcome wanted and horizon.
