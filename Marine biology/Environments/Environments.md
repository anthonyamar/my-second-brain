## Substrates environments
Environements are the first thing we need to understand as a Marine Biologist following the level 1 course. 

Species are living in an environement because they find an interest and the good conditions. We can talk about environement/species adequation. 

There are different environements or substrates: 
- [Sidewalk](Sidewalk.md)
- [Overhang](Overhang.md)
- [Drooping](Drooping.md)
- [Scree](Scree.md)
- [Faults](Faults.md)
- [Sand](Sand.md)
- [Caves](Caves.md)
- [Coralligenous](Coralligenous.md)
- [Herbaria](Herbaria.md)

Understanding the environements lead to better finding the species, because we know what we can find, why the specy is here, and how the specy is living.

## Layers
Substrates are located in [Aquatic layers](Aquatic%20layers.md). 

## Environment factors
The combination of these different environment factors can create as many environments where species can live: 
`Substrates * factor1 * factor2 * factor3 = 1 specific environment`
I.e : [Infralittoral](Infralittoral.md) photophile rock in calm mode. 

### Salinity
- Pure water
- Salted water in which the content varies from one sea to another (Atlantic 32 to 35% ; Mediterranean 36% to 40%)
- Intermediate zone between pure and salted water - lagune ; These are called paralic environments. 

### Temperature
- Important component and essential to the specie distribution.
- Just like the salinity, the temperature can cause temporary mortality, or even the disapearing of certain species if it is changed (climate change) 

### Light
- Full light
- Indirect light
- Shadow
- Obscurity
- Photophile or [Sciaphyle](Sciaphyle.md) species.
- [Algae](Algae.md) are favored. A low light favor fixed species.

### Hydrodynamism
- Current
- Swing
- Waves and swells more or less pronounce depending on the wind force
### Turbidity
- Clear 
- Trouble
- Turbid
- Brackish (saum√¢tre in french)
- Turbidity don't come only from sand, but can be organic matter. 

### Pressure
- We, divers, are insensitive to small variation of pressure, but fish are. 

### Pollution
- Presence of different chemicals that can pertubate organisms.
