The mesolittoral (also called mesopellagic zone), is the one that goes from 200 to 1000m, between the [Mediolittoral](Mediolittoral.md) (above) and the [Bathyal zone](Bathyal.md) (under). It is the first layer of the aphotic zone, because less than 1% of the light comme through. 

Even though it's deep, there some people who'd dive in it, as the world record is at 332,35m (Ahmed Gamal Gabr)
