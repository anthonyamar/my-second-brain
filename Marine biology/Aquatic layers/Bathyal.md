The [bathyal zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathyal_zone) (also known as bathypelagic) is situated from 1000 to 4000m, just before the [Abyssopelagic](Abyssal.md) zone. This zone is a bit more welcoming than the abyssal one, but still, there's at least no light (here's why this zone can be called "midnight" or "twilight") and the average temperature is around 4Â°. It is the zone where we can see the last phytoplankton, some whales, sharks, giant squid and blind fishes.
