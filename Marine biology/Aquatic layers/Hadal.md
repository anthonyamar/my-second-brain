The hadal (also known as hadopelagic zone) stage is everything deeper than 6000m. This region is about 1% of the oceans, with a total obscurity and a 4Â° constant temperature. Mostly faults and pits that are ocean's bottom. This is the deepest stage in earth. 

The most known hadal environment is the [Mariana Trench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_Trench). At this point, life still exist but it's very rare and it is near hyrdrothermal vents. Mostly [Crustaceas](Crustaceas.md) and small organisms. The deepest known point in the Mariana Trench is at 10,984m (~11km).
