Cnidaria is phylus that shelter :
- Jellyfish
- [Sea anemones](Sea%20anemones.md)
- Coral
- [Gorgonians](Alcyonacea%20(Gorgonians%20corals).md)
- Hydra

The three important class to know at first are the **anthozoas**, **hydrozoas** and **scyphozoas**. 

They nearly all are predators, killing by paralysis. Their sting can cause harmful epidermic reactions on humans, and some pain can last more than months. 

The unique characteristic of the cnidaria phylum is their cnidocyte. The cell responsible for the stingness. When the cnidocil is stimulated, it will create a mechanic reaction that will discharge the cnidocyste through the operculum at speed of 700 nanoseconds. They can feed themselves using this, by capturing microorganisms such as plankton, larvae, copepods...
