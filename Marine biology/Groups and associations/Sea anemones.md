Sea anemones are predatorian animals from the order of Actinaria, classed in the [Cnidaria](Cnidaria.md) group. Animals, especialy fishes, stay in it to hide from their predatorians. 

They can shelter :
- Clownfish (thus the nickname anemonefish)
- Crab (inachus phalangium)
- Gobies (common, speckled)

During a dive, we can push the water to create a bit of current that will bend the tentacles and better see what's in the anemone.
