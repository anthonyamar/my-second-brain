It is mandatory to organize the dive before going to the water in order to not being surprised by our parameters and exogenous events. 

In addition to the standard [Dive planification](Dive%20planification.md), we can prepare our dive by discussing these topics:
- Same interests? (fishes, evolving in the water, dive concept, mollusks, fauna/flora...)
- Define a principal goal (species?)
- Define a secondary goal (other species?)
- Privileged [Environments](Environments.md)
- Photos? Videos? 
- Gesture to announce species

The diving director brief can help to understand and choosing what kind of species we will see. 

Just like other dive, it is mandatory to stay attentive to the group, and your security parameters: the gas consommation, decompression stops, depth...

A good marine biology dive is:
- Minimum 50 minutes
- Explore the maximum of [Environments](Environments.md) because it lead to a maximum of species.
