# Decision
- Choice between two or more solutions that will imply a consequence.
- The absence of choice is a choice and how I consider existensialism 
- Choosing is renouncing

# Underlying causes of a decision
- Searching for the better outcome
- The quality of a decision and the morale

# Consituant or anatomy of a decision
- A vector of weights

# Nature of influences
- How influences create modify the weights

## Constantial influences and the human limitations
- Let an Apple fall and hoping that it will go up is irrational 
- Influentialism through empiricisim - A weight tend toward infinity rather than being 100% sure
## Inconscious influences, the social and biological influences on humans
- Emotions, biological needs
- Social constructions and how we're choosing related to others
## Conscious influences, the ones that we're experiencing by our senses
- Influences that we tend to take into account because we'd experience it

# Weight and balance between influences
- Vector of weight

# Browsing of a decision graph
- How the chess player take decisions
- Abstracting constantial and inconscious influences to focus on conscious influences
  
# Back and forth propagation in the decision graph
- How the abstraction let us go forward in a graph and change the weight of conscious influences 
- Constantly re-evaluate decision at node[0] through time

# Way to change our influences
- There's no determinism, but various influences we have that we can model through our choices and our environment
- Any change in any influence involve a cost, whether it's time, money and/or energy. Even the constantial ones: you can act against gravity. Rocket does. But they do it by deploying a colossal amount of energy and that arrives because of the time and energy spent in creating a technology that actually succeed to. 
- Any changes in influence involve an evaluation of the cost and the futur state of other influences in forward decisions.

# Way to ponderate through experience
- By multiplying experiences, we're extending the variety of influences, their weight and thus our decision process
- modifying the way we're reacting to some influences also ponderate. Stoicism influence. If you give more weight to one particular event, that could act as an influence, you'll be modifying the next decision you'll take. This could be anything, like how people around you will judge you based on that decision will obviously make the probability of taking that decision to evolve, in a positive or negative way. 

# Libertarianism through influentialism or why we're free
- At the end, we're always free to choose between one decision or another, but we'll always tend to the decision that has the same outcome
- Unlike Sartre's writings, we're not making choices out of a an equaly individuals decision vector but inequals one, where inequality is created by the weight of a decision
- Because we're able to change the way we respond to influences as well as changing our environment to modify the weight of influences, we're can still be considered as mastering our life, thus be free.
