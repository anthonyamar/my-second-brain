> The way we think of ourselves is largely shaped by what we believed other think of us, and we tend to act according to the expectations that we think others have.

Educate childrens by creating positive metaphorical identifications will empower them as they're shaped by the expectation we have for them. 

It is tied to the “positive thinking” concept. By thinking positive, you're shaping a reality where the positive is the norm. 

This principle is also good for #management and social (love, friendly or cordial) relationships. By verbally expecting from people to have certain positive quality, we help them to shape this reality in their mind easier and achieve their goals faster. I.e., telling someone is “always motivate and up to make good work", “always on point", "make always good works", will help the person to act in accordance of the way people see him/her. Someone characterized as a winner or a looser in all circumstances will continue to conform himself to this and will tend to accept and interiorize his condition.
