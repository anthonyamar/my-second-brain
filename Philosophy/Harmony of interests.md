That pheonomenom of "harmony of interest", through and leaded by [The invisible hand](The%20invisible%20hand.md), refers to the abitlity of the market to self-correct anomalies with no intervention on the part of government or other organizations, creating a natural balance in prices, acting naturally on supply and needs. 

This can be observed and nearly validated when there's inflation: when the cost of life becomes higher, merchants margin will be shrinked. Naturally, these merchants will tend to rise their price, still in this concept of egoist interest, to keep their margin intact. By rising the price incrementaly, buyers will not have the ability to still buy the products, so the merchants will forcely have fewer clients, so less turnover and interest. They will be less attractive to buyers. At the time this higher point is reached, and everyone searching for their own interest, one merchant will start to lower his prices to gain in attractivity, forcing his competitors to do so, and the prices will start to fall. 

This is obviously very summarized, and the prices variations and the harmonization of interest can be more complicated than that, but we can easily understand that the catalyst of the price movement is first the self-interest.
