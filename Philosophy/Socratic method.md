The socratic method is a form of argumentative dialog between two or more individuals. It consists on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and create ideas and underlying presuppositions. 

The dialog form is important, as it create an horizontality between the people: it's about argumentation and brainstorming, not about some having the truth on other. 

Extending questions using the socratic method is a great way to find new problems, and thus, new ideas ([Seek for problems rather than ideas](Seek%20for%20problems%20rather%20than%20ideas.md)). It also helps create a stronger demonstrative argumentation about some ideas we could have to defend (like in convincing skeptics investor that you're the right startup to invest in - see [pitching a VC](Pitching%20a%20VC%20-%20SaaS%20case.md)).
