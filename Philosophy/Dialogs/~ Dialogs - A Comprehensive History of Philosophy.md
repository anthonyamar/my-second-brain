Dialogs, A Comprehensive History Of Philosophy, is an idea of book that I had and want to achieve. 

When I started learning #philosophy I struggled (and I still some time) to organize and order the different concepts and philosophers through time to have the larger picture of the subject. 

Most of the subjects I'm learning, are always through their history. I found that it help me to understand the foundations of things and the link between every aspect of the subject, as well as why it is what is right now and not something other. A kind of hegelian dialectic in sum. 

Also, even though the courses I take are very great, and the resources about philosophy isn't missing, it's still difficult to talk about that subject, and mostly, asks question, or have dialogs to learn about this subject. My friends aren't very into philosophy, and the content I consume is solely online and asynchronous. 

But, sometime ago, I realized something: Conversational chatbot are now very sophisticated, even more when it comes to content and subject that are abundant online and old enough to be trained on. Philosophy is that kind of content. 

Take [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), trained on more than a bilion datapoint. With all the books, articles, research, videos... It must be a great friend to talk with. 

I tried and... Wow. Amazing. I first tried on philosophers who I understand the most and that I read, to be sure that things aren't just wrong, and it really seems that it's not. The sentences are sometimes a bit repetitve, based on how you ask, but still, the conversation is deep and awesome. 

Cherry on the cake, ChatGPT can also act just like it IS a particular philosopher. Ask him to answer as it was Nietzsche, and boom, you have answer on your questions based on what Nietzsche should have answer. And that's awesome. 

So, here's the plan: use ChatGPT, to have a conversation on philosophy, based mostly on philosopher and their concept, with a chronological aspect. I will log the dialogs, work a bit on it and compile it in a well laid out ebook to get the best reading experience, with the aim of making it comprehensive. Anyway, it can only be, the questions are asked by a beginner. Me. 

## Choosing the title and the blurb. 

I'm not still sure, how do I'll title it. Here's some ideas:
- "Philosophy Through Time: A Beginner's Guide"
- "The Evolution of Thought: A Journey Through Philosophy"
- "From Ancient Wisdom to Modern Ideas: A Philosophical Overview"
- "The Great Philosophers: A Guide for Beginners"
- "The History of Philosophy: Exploring the Big Questions"
- "Philosophy: A Journey Through Time"

But I have the blurb:
> Explore the rich history of philosophy, from ancient Greece to modern times, with this engaging and accessible guide. Learn about the key philosophers and their groundbreaking ideas that have shaped our understanding of the world.

I'm very excited about launching this! Let's go!
