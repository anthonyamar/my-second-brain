**Anthony**: Here we go, let's talk about philosophy. I want to extend my knowledge on this topic, and mostly understand, how in history philosophy had evolved through philosophers and their ideas. Before we start to talk about the philosophers themselves, I want to understand more about philosophy in a broader way. First of all, how would you describe what is philosophy to a complete beginner?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Philosophy is the study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. It is a broad field that encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including metaphysics (the study of reality and the nature of things), epistemology (the study of knowledge), ethics (the study of moral values and principles), logic (the study of reasoning), and aesthetics (the study of beauty and taste).

Philosophy seeks to understand the world and our place in it, and to answer questions about the meaning and purpose of life. It is concerned with the most fundamental questions about existence, and is often concerned with questions that cannot be answered through scientific means.

Philosophy is not just a body of knowledge, but a way of thinking and approaching problems. Philosophers use critical thinking, logical reasoning, and argumentation to explore and understand the world around us. They ask questions, evaluate arguments, and engage in lively debates to arrive at a deeper understanding of the world and our place in it.

In short, philosophy is the love of wisdom, and it is a quest to gain a deeper understanding of the world and our place in it.

--------
**Anthony**: What is the most ancient shape of philosophy? Where did all this started?

--------
**ChatGPT**: The roots of philosophy can be traced back to ancient Greece, specifically to the city-state of Athens in the 5th century BCE. It was in Athens that the first philosophers began to explore questions about the nature of reality, ethics, and knowledge in a systematic and critical way.

One of the earliest philosophers was Thales of Miletus, who is considered by many to be the father of Western philosophy. He was interested in the natural world and sought to explain the underlying principles that govern it. He believed that the world was made up of a single substance, which he believed to be water.

Other early Greek philosophers, such as Anaximander, Anaximenes, and Pythagoras, also made important contributions to the development of philosophy. They asked questions about the nature of the universe, the relationship between mind and body, and the meaning of ethics and morality.

The works of these early philosophers laid the foundation for the development of philosophy as a distinct discipline, and their ideas influenced later philosophers, such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. These philosophers, in turn, shaped the development of Western philosophy and helped to establish it as a critical and reflective field of study.

It's worth noting that philosophy has a rich history in other cultures as well. For example, ancient Indian philosophy dates back to around the 6th century BCE and encompasses a wide range of traditions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Ancient Chinese philosophy, which dates back to the 5th century BCE, is centered around Confucianism, Taoism, and Legalism.

--------
**Anthony**: Can we consider religion statements and values, written in their respective holy books (Torah, Bible, Coran...) as "philosophy" in some way?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Religious texts and beliefs can certainly contain philosophical elements and address philosophical questions, such as questions about the meaning and purpose of life, the nature of morality and ethics, and the relationship between the individual and the divine. However, religion is generally seen as a distinct field from philosophy, and the two are often distinguished from each other.

While both philosophy and religion address similar questions and concerns, they approach these questions from different perspectives and with different methods. Philosophy relies on reason, logic, and critical thinking to arrive at understanding and knowledge, while religion often relies on faith and revelation.

That being said, the relationship between philosophy and religion is complex, and there have been many philosophers throughout history who have been deeply influenced by religious ideas and beliefs. For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Plato was influenced by Pythagoreanism, which was a philosophical and religious movement that aimed to understand the nature of the universe. Similarly, the medieval philosopher Thomas Aquinas was heavily influenced by his Christian faith and sought to reconcile Aristotelian philosophy with Catholic theology.

In conclusion, while religious texts and beliefs can contain philosophical elements, they are generally seen as distinct from philosophy. Nevertheless, the relationship between philosophy and religion has been a complex and dynamic one throughout history.

**Anthony**: Ok, very interesting! Does philosophy only takes place in a theoretical aspect, or does it, somehow, have real and concrete applications in everyday life?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Philosophy can have both theoretical and practical aspects, and its impact on everyday life can be significant. While philosophy may initially appear to be a purely abstract and theoretical discipline, it can have practical implications and applications in a variety of areas.

For example, the field of ethics, which is a branch of philosophy concerned with questions about morality and right and wrong, has a direct impact on how we live our lives and make decisions. The ethical principles and theories developed by philosophers, such as utilitarianism and deontology, can guide our behavior and inform our decision-making in areas such as business, politics, and personal relationships.

Similarly, the philosophy of mind and the study of consciousness have important implications for fields such as psychology and artificial intelligence, as they explore questions about the nature of the mind, self, and consciousness.

In the realm of education, philosophy can help us to think critically and reflectively about the purposes and goals of education and the nature of knowledge and truth.

Moreover, the study of epistemology, or the theory of knowledge, has important implications for fields such as journalism, science, and the law, as it explores questions about the sources and limits of knowledge and how we can determine what is true and what is not.

In short, while philosophy may begin as a purely theoretical discipline, its ideas and theories can have real and concrete implications for how we live our lives and understand the world around us.

--------
**Anthony**: So, it's correct to say that, everyone can, even should, approach philosophy?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Yes, it's correct to say that everyone can and, in many ways, should approach philosophy. Philosophy is a discipline that is concerned with some of the most fundamental and universal questions about the world and our place in it. As such, it is a field of study that can be valuable and relevant to people from all walks of life, regardless of their background or profession.

Approaching philosophy can help individuals to develop their critical thinking skills, improve their ability to reason and analyze arguments, and gain a deeper understanding of the world and the issues that affect them and others. Additionally, by engaging in philosophical inquiry, individuals can broaden their perspectives, challenge their assumptions, and broaden their understanding of the world and the people in it.

Of course, not everyone needs to become a professional philosopher, but engaging with philosophical ideas and questions can be a valuable and enriching experience for anyone who is interested in exploring the deeper meaning and purpose of life.

--------
**Anthony**: I agree with you. Philosophy really helped me to shape my thoughts, discover new point of views, sharpen my reasoning skills and extend my mind with more openness. 

You said above that philosophy is the broader field that enclose many disciplines, among others, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, logic and aesthetics. Could you develop on that please?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Certainly! Philosophy is a broad and interdisciplinary field that encompasses a number of different sub-disciplines, each of which addresses its own specific set of questions and issues. Here is a brief overview of some of the major branches of philosophy:

Metaphysics: This branch of philosophy is concerned with the nature of reality, including questions about the existence of God, the nature of time and space, and the relationship between mind and matter.

Epistemology: This branch of philosophy is concerned with questions about knowledge, including what counts as knowledge, the limits of human knowledge, and the nature of justification and belief.

Ethics: Ethics is the branch of philosophy that deals with questions about morality, including what is right and wrong, what is good and evil, and what makes an action moral or immoral.

Logic: This branch of philosophy is concerned with the principles and methods of reasoning, including questions about valid and invalid arguments, the nature of proof, and the foundations of mathematics.

Aesthetics: Aesthetics is the branch of philosophy that deals with questions about beauty, taste, and the arts, including questions about the nature of art, the criteria for evaluating works of art, and the relationship between art and the audience.

These are just a few examples of the branches of philosophy, and there are many others as well, such as political philosophy, philosophy of science, philosophy of language, and philosophy of religion, to name a few. Each of these branches of philosophy seeks to address its own unique set of questions and problems, but all of them are connected by a common interest in exploring the big questions of life and the world around us.

--------
**Anthony**: I understand. Does the philosophers we all know, address every field of philosophy and try to have a complete approach, or do they are forced to specialize because of how wide every field is?

--------
**ChatGPT**: Most philosophers tend to specialize in one or a few specific branches of philosophy, rather than attempting to address every field. This is due, in part, to the sheer breadth and depth of philosophy as a discipline. There are so many questions and issues to explore within each branch of philosophy that it would be impossible for any one person to have a complete and comprehensive understanding of every field.

Additionally, the study of philosophy often requires years of training and specialized knowledge, as well as a deep understanding of the history and tradition of each branch of philosophy. It is not uncommon for philosophers to spend their entire careers studying and working within a single area of philosophy, such as ethics or epistemology.

Of course, there are some philosophers who have made contributions to multiple branches of philosophy, and who are known for their work in several different areas. However, even these philosophers tend to have areas of specialization, where their expertise and contributions are particularly significant.

In short, while philosophy is a wide and interdisciplinary field, most philosophers tend to specialize in one or a few areas, in order to have a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the questions and issues they are exploring.

--------
**Anthony**: You just said that philosophy often requires years of training and specialized knowledge. How do people who didn't catch up with philosophy at school can start to get into this and take pleasure studying?

--------
**ChatGPT**: If you didn't have the opportunity to study philosophy in school, or if you simply want to explore the field on your own, there are many ways to get started. Here are a few suggestions:

Read introductory texts: There are many great introductory texts that provide an overview of philosophy and its various branches. These books are often written in an accessible and engaging style, and can help you gain a broad understanding of the field and the key concepts and questions that philosophers have explored over the centuries.

Take online courses: There are many online courses and resources that can help you learn more about philosophy, including MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) that are available for free. These courses can provide a structured way to study philosophy and can help you build your understanding of the subject step by step.

Participate in discussion groups: Joining a philosophy discussion group, either in person or online, can be a great way to learn more about the subject and to engage with others who are interested in the same questions and ideas. In these groups, you can hear different perspectives, ask questions, and explore the subject in a collaborative and supportive environment.

Read primary texts: Once you have a basic understanding of philosophy and its various branches, you can start reading primary texts written by philosophers themselves. This can be a great way to delve deeper into the subject and to get a better understanding of the ideas and arguments that have shaped the field over time.

Find a local philosophy group: Many cities have local philosophy groups that meet regularly to discuss different philosophical ideas and issues. Attending these groups can be a great way to learn more about philosophy and to engage with others who are interested in the subject.

These are just a few of the many ways to get started with studying philosophy on your own. The most important thing is to find a method that works for you and that allows you to explore the subject in a way that is engaging and meaningful.

--------
**Anthony**: It's a bit counterintuitive, compared to other matters, that philosophy NOT start with studying primary texts. In example, for a beginner, you advise against starting with the classics of philosophy, written by the philosophers we all know? Are they too difficult at first?

--------
**ChatGPT**: It's true that with some subjects, it's natural to start with the primary texts written by the experts in the field. However, with philosophy, starting with the primary texts can often be a challenging experience for beginners, for a few reasons:

Philosophy can be dense and abstract: Many philosophical texts are written in a dense and abstract style, and can be difficult to understand without some background knowledge and context.

Historical context is important: Philosophy is a subject with a long history, and many of the primary texts were written in a different time and place, with different cultural and philosophical assumptions. Understanding the historical context in which these texts were written can be crucial to understanding their meaning and significance.

The language can be challenging: Many philosophical texts were written in ancient languages, such as Greek or Latin, or in the language of the philosopher's own time and culture, which may be different from contemporary English.

For these reasons, starting with introductory texts that provide a overview of philosophy and its various branches, and that are written in an accessible and engaging style, can be a helpful way to build your understanding of the subject and to provide context for the primary texts you will encounter later.

Of course, once you have a basic understanding of philosophy and its various branches, it can be incredibly rewarding to delve into the primary texts and to explore the ideas and arguments of the great philosophers in more depth. But starting with introductory texts can be a great way to build a foundation and to get a sense of the overall landscape of the field.

--------
**Anthony**: I truly felled this. When I first wanted to dig into philosophy, I took a random book in my local library's philosophy row, vaguely choosed by the name that seemed familiar to me. I took Plato

--------
**ChatGPT**: Plato is definitely one of the most famous and influential philosophers in the Western tradition, and reading his works can be a great way to get started with philosophy. However, it's important to keep in mind that Plato's works can be challenging for beginners, for some of the reasons I mentioned earlier.

If you're just starting out with philosophy, you might want to try starting with some introductory texts that provide an overview of the subject and its history, before diving into Plato's works. That way, you'll have a better context for understanding his ideas and arguments, and you'll be better equipped to appreciate their significance.

Once you have a solid foundation, you can then turn to Plato's works with more confidence, and you'll be able to explore his ideas in more depth and to see how they fit into the broader landscape of philosophy.

--------
**Anthony**: After this failed attempt of starting philosophy, stopped trying for years until I discover a French YouTuber and podcaster name "Le Précepteur", who have an easier approach of philosophy, that allowed me to put my foot in the stirrup. This had a huge impact on me and my understanding of that subject. He is very great, but only available in French. Do you have some recommendations of YouTube channels, podcasts, audiobooks, blogs or other beginner-friendly formats in English?
