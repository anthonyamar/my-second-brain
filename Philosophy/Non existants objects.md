Language allows us to conceptualise imaginary worlds in our mind. Non existants objects are concept where the word doesn't refer to a tangible thing. A lot of words are non existants object, such as [Morality](Morality.md), trust, love, good, bad... there's no tangible or sensible way of describing those words, because they doesn't exist as a physical thing. Thus the "Non existants objects" term.
