The invisible hand is a concept that was first enounced by Adam Smith, a scotish philosopher, in his two major works "Theory of Moral Sentiments" (TMS) and [An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations I](La%20Richesse%20Des%20Nations%20I%20-%20Adam%20Smith.md), or simply "The Wealth of a Nation" (TWN), and briefly in another of his work, refered rather as the "invisible hand of Jupiter"

This statement was interpreted in numerous ways, especially because of the ambivalence between these two major books. In TMS, Smith seems to describe the invisible hand more in favor of the altruisme: it is the idea that one's is truly driven by empathy and compassion. 

In TWN, Smith seems to describe it more in favor of the egoism: it is the idea that one pursues his egoist interest, he's contributing to the common good, more than if he'll actually have willing to. 

Say otherwise : one is better working for his nation by prioritizing his own interest rather than actually working directly for it (by truly being driven by altruism), even though his interest in the nation's interests does not come into play. Just like he is guided by an invisible hand. 

Based on this principle, egoism is the engine of growth and prosperity of a nation. The Invisible Hand, is the magic phenomenom that guide people to actually pursue their interest and harmonize the interests of each one to create the prosperity and the wealth of a nation. And where [Morality](Morality.md) condemns the egoism, the #economy exalt and make the ego a virtue. 

The invisble hand, is Smith's way of saying : "Outcome does not necesseraly align with people's intention, and when the outcome can sometimes be negative, overall, they have a positive effect on society".

 Smith is demonstrating this using the butcher illustration: A butcher does not make good meat because he actually wants everyone to eat the best meat, but because, by making good meat, people will prefer to go in his shop rather than the competitor's one, so he will, in fact, make a better client retention, thus more money. It is his personal interest that drives him to make a better job. 

It could be the same story using workers. They do not make a great home in the pure interest of the one who'll live in, but because, if they're good, the family that will live in will be more up to recommand the worker to their friend. So the worker will have more work, as well as fewer problems or post sale support. This is in his interest, and humans are fundamentaly egoists. 

This is illustrating what we could call the “Merchant interest” : the better the work is, the better the worker makes money.
