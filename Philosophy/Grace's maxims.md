2. We shouldn't be more informative than required. Do not provide too many details.

## Quality

2. Don't claim when you don't have sufficient evidences. Fact check as much as possible to provide clear information, according to the first point.

## Relations
1. Say relevant things. Things that don't interest anyone is boring.

## Manner
