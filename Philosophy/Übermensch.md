The Übermensch is a central concept in Nietzsche philosophy, enounced in his book Thus Spoke Zaratoustra, as a goal to humanity. 

The Übermensch is no longer playing in the hand of a specific god, reject the duality and overcome the evil, becoming what he truly is, living with [The will to power](The%20will%20to%20power.md). 

It is the one who has freed himself from all [Dualism](Dualism.md), no longer finds himself in this [Morality](Morality.md) of ressentment and who accept the imanance. That is to say, the only existing reality without looking for another because this would be to demonstrate our inability to be able to adapt and therefore, demonstrate our weakness. 

One's goal of becoming the Übermensch is about searching completeness over perfection and avoid pouring in [Nihilism](Nihilism.md).
