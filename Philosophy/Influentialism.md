At the crossroads of existentialism, rationalism and empirism, influentialism is the view that any decision is made under the influences of an infinite number of parameters. That view acknoledge that, even though we're under various influences, we're still free to take the decision we want to. It is a form of philosophical inquiry that explores the question of libertarianism.

If you're familiar with philosophy, you may have realized that Influentialism isn't a "real" theory, meaning that, it doesn't come from a known philosopher. Influentialism is a neologism that I think can resume how I see the question of libertarianism. 

In this note, I'll be extending that view accross multiple sections :
- Of the decision
- Underlying causes of a decision
- Constituant and anatomy of a decision
- Nature of influences
	- Constantial influences and the human limitations
	- Inconscious influences, the social and biological influences on humans
	- Conscious influences, that we're experiencing by our senses
- Weight and balance between influences
- Browse of a decision graph
- Back and forth propagation in the decision graph
- Way to change our influences
- Way to ponderate through experience
- Libertarianism through influentialism, or, why we're free
