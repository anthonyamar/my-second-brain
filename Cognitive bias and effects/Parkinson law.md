The Parkinson law is saying that an individual tend to fill the time he·she set aside for. 

I.e, if we gives us 1 hour to complete a task, there's a bigger chance for us that we will finish it in this time frame, even if the task could objectively took us 10 minutes. 

Morality, better restricting time on a task to complete it faster, thanks to the Parkinson Law.
