The experience on obediance and authority that made people question on moral.

The experience were made to measure the level of obediance of american people and were made through three people: 2 actors, one act as a student that will receive electric current discharge if he don't answer right to the questions. And the second who act as the autority, a scientific who's here to say to the third guy (the experiment's subject, not an actor) to continue the experience. 

That third guy have a control panel under his hand and the ability to inflict a (fake) electric current to the guy behind the glass. The panel is displaying the current voltage and goes to 450v with an excplicite "caution: this can damage" message.

The experience shows that 65% of the subject had inflicted the maximum electric shock under the autority of the scientific, even if they manifest a lack of moral or any reluctance to inflict this. 

This show how we can be influenced by people with an autority induced by his/her title (here, a scientific) even against our moral.
