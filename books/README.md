# Books

Books is one of my main passion. I started to read very seriously when I was somehting like 17 years old. I had a library in my room with various books that belonged to various members of my family (mostly father and grandfather). They weren't very sharp about what they were reading and most of books were just mainstream references from their age (I guess), rose water stories, presents and practical books. Not very interesting books in short. 

To be really honest, I started to read just because I was absolutly bored at this time. I'd just been kicked out of school and didn't find any job. Playing guitar all the day was cool but I wanted new things. The first book I pick in my library was "Journey into the center of Earth" from Jules Verne. It still remains one of my favorite book of all time, all styles combined. What a chance to fall on this one, because it really sparked my love for books. Even if it took me about a year to almost finish it! Reading an entire book at this time was for me a big challenge. I stoped it something like 30 pages just before the end, too difficult for me at that time. (I read it again, and in full this time, some years after). 

I never give up reading books, even if I didn't finish them at the first time I started to read. Everything takes time, and for an absolute non-scholar person like me, reading was very hard! It took me something like 2 or 3 years to really start reading everyday and finishing books. At first, I even don't show it to other people around me. When I was in college, admit you're reading was something like admiting to people that you're a nerd, in a bad way. 

My reading skills and needs started to take off when I discover that books weren't only about love stories from Balzac and Zola and was also about finding thoughts about any subject you want. The first kind of books I found love in was personal development. The first book that had a big impact on me was "Unlimited power" from the great Tony Robbins. I discover it on a seduction forum, so yes, I basically started to read because I thought it was helping me to pickup girls ðŸ˜…. 

Well, I did not find how to be more attractive with women in it but I can say this book had a very huge impact on my life and it learned something way more valuable than how to pickup girls : anything can be learn, and it always can start with a book. So I started compulsively buying books and keeping them. Now, I say I'm collecting books. I have more than 260 books now and guess what? My interest for books is still growing. 

What I found absolutly amazing about books, among others, is that this object allow anybody to access the ideas of the wisest and most creative minds that the world ever gave birth to! And, as writing exist since the dawn of time, books traverse the history so that anyone can time travel (sort of) or even possessed pieces of history. 

So here, I'll be writing about books : the books I love, the books I collect, the curiosities and my collection of old books and why and how I buy some.
