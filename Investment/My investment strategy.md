## How do I invest my money

I'm still a modest investor, learning how to wisely use my money to leverage every euro I have. It's still new for me, as I really digged on this topic since the middle of the pandemic (~septembre 2020) and because a lot of my friends around me have this dynamic, some at modest levels and other at the limit of making it a living. 

There's a lot of way to invest money. Of course, not every investments are relevant for every one. The first thing I learned about investment, which seems to me something important, is how are you defining your aversion to risk. 

Depending of your risk profile, you'll be more inclined to invest in a specific type of assets instead of another. Your risk profile is also highly influence by your way of living such as your work and family situation. 

For me, living with my parents and feeling no pressure about inconventionnal path or way of living, but not having that much money, I'm situating myself on a mid + risk profile and it shows in my [saving habits](Saving%20habit.md).

I'm not afraid of living with a little money or to lose some and more inspired by the "High risk, high gain" maxim. So I'm more naturally attracted by investments like trading, cryptocurrencies, [NFTs](Non%20Fungible%20Tokens%20(NFT).md) or bordeline strategies and new borned services. 

For now, I'm mostly investing money on: 
- [Old books](Old%20books.md)
- [State controlled saving plans](State%20controlled%20saving%20plans.md)
- [Stock markets](Stock%20markets.md)
- [Cryptocurrencies](Cryptocurrencies.md)
- [Real estate](Real%20estate.md)
