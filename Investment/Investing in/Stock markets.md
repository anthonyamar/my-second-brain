## Investing in stock markets

I'm totally new to this, but enjoying it. I had been introduce to this practice by my cofounder who start trading by his early 20 and I'm enjoying his experience. 

Buying my first stocks made me understand a lot about investment and also shift my mindset about how I perceive investment and risk. I had in mind this belief (popular belief I guess) that stock market are for professionnals and are highly risky because you could lose everything. 

This belief truly lack of one important thing I learned while starting to trade : every one (should) have it's own investment thesis. And for a lot of beginner, the most basic strategy you learn and start with is the "buy and hold" strategy, mostly tied to a long term investment thesis. 

This is how I'm seeing stock market trading right now : a long term (+10y) investment. So I prefer strong companies that showed a solid growth over time with a low volatility to high growth company with a higher volatiliy. 

I also learned about [[Exchange Traded Funds (ETF)]], which are by design, more secure assets than a regular stock, making it easier to invest money on the stock markets. I'm following a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy on two ETFs : [PE500](https://www.amundietf.fr/particuliers/product/view/FR0013412285) that replicate the performance of the american market and [PAEEM](https://www.amundietf.fr/particuliers/product/view/FR0013412020), that replicates the performance of emerging markets including Asia biggest corporations (Tencent, Alibaba, Samsung, Baidu...). For now, it perform very well and I'm happy with this strategy! 

As I'm still a beginner, I'm still learning about stock picking : the art of choosing the right stock and buy it at the best time. And what I can say so far, is that's it's not easy at all. ðŸ˜„
