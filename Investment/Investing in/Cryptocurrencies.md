## Investing in cryptocurrencies

I first time heard about Bitcoin when I made my first trip on the darknet. I was curious about what the heck was that mysterious darknet. Finaly nothing very interesting, but I kept documenting cryptoanarchism mouvments and of course, cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin. At that time, it was at something like 500â‚¬. Which seemed absolutely huge! 

As I was still a student, I hadn't money to put on this. Also, it wasn't mainstream as it is right now. It wasn't very secure and well documented. Mining as well, wasn't very documented and seemed like impossible if you weren't familiar with code, so I gived up on buying. How wrong I was... 

When it hit the first so called "bubble" at 18k in 2018, I was like "Bitcoin make no sense, it's a bubble, everyone would lose it's money, I would not buy it now." How wrong I was too...

When the bubble explode, falling at 3k, I was like "Well, cool, I'll buy some one day now it's affordable". I procrastinated and never bought some. 

To stop crying about the train I left past, I decided to buy some with and commit to a long term strategy. But damn, at 40k! 

I really like the history and the purpose of bitcoin, even if I really think I'm arriving very late and that Bitcoin is becomming a "boomer" thing. What I'm now targeting is Ether, based on Ethereum blockchain. Even if it's already popular, I think that it's the most promising cryptocurrency here, because of it's versatility and the wide range of usage, out of just currency, such as smart contracts based innovations like [Non Fungible Tokens (NFT)](Non%20Fungible%20Tokens%20(NFT).md). 

I consider [buying cryptocurrencies](Buying%20cryptocurrencies.md) as a high risk investment and I'm trying to lowering this risk by targeting long term sell (+5y).
