## The saving habit
What's also seems to be consensus is that saving should be an habit. And also that there's no too little savings. Saving 10â‚¬/month is still better than not saving at all. And it force to construct healthy money [habits](Adopting%20new%20habits.md). 

I like to think my saving in flux and save into different vaults :
- I save 30% of all my incomes. 
- I sometimes have to pay 20% delayed taxes depending the company with which I'm charging the client. When it's the case, I block 20% for the taxes, and 20 other % for saving.

Then I split the money save into my three different vaults like this :
 - 100% [Emergency fund](Emergency%20fund.md) until it reach `8 * monthly burn rate` then only 20% 
- 50% for #travel and [Scuba diving](Scuba%20diving.md) equipment in my [state controlled saving plan](State%20controlled%20saving%20plans.md)
- 30% in my investment strategy: [cryptocurrencies](Cryptocurrencies.md), [stock markets](Stock%20markets.md) and [real estate](Real%20estate.md). 

The remaining amount of money is keep on my day to day bank account to make my basic operations and buyings.
