## Why and how I started to care about my money.
It took me a lot of time to really start caring about how I manage my #money. Habitually, I'm the kind of person who spend his money without looking too much.

Having a company helped me to figured out how important it is to have a meticulous money management. If you don't do well with this when you run a company, well... You'll don't run it very long. 

In France, money can be a big taboo. People don't really talk about money nor how to manage it and even less how to be wealthier. This is not something we're learning about at school and most people just don't care about personal money management, and worst, it's often refered as something bad. 

I started to work on how I manage my money when I started to learn about investment, mostly from my friend and co-founder Aurélien. This obviously have been accelerated by my company's growth but also by the fact I stoped earning recurring money from a day to day job and started to earn more from opportunity revenues, mostly teaching, where it's not rare to get your money 4 to 6 month after doing the job. So I really needed to be clearer on how I save and spend my money. 

2020 was a great year to start investing and get a more accurate eye on my money as my expenses really slowed down. Aurélien introduced me to #trading and #real-estate #investments ment, as well as personal finance management. 

This really changed my way of thinking about money and I think, more than ever, that having the control over my money is making me more motivated to accomplish the things that matter to me and also significatively reduce my mental charge, which allow me to improve my #productivity, and be more aware and peaceful. 

## The saving habit
What's also seems to be consensus is that saving should be an habit. And also that there's no too little savings. Saving 10€/month is still better than not saving at all. And it force to construct healthy money #habits. 

I like to think my saving in flux and save into different vaults :
- I save 30% of all my incomes. 
- I sometimes have to pay 20% delayed taxes depending the company with which I'm charging the client. When it's the case, I block 20% for the taxes, and 20 other % for saving.

Then I split the money save into my three different vaults like this :
 - 100% Emergency fund until it reach 8 * monthly burn rate then only 20% 
- 50% for #travel and [Scuba diving](Scuba%20diving.md) equipment
- 30% in long term risk investment such as real estate or trading \(#ETF mostly).
