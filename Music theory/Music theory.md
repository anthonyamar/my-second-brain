One of my favorite subject in music. I had long periods in school digging deep into very obscure theory and read a lot of very specific book hidden in music libraries. I also had the honor to study music theory during 2 years with Derek Sebastian, one of the most eminent music theorist in France \(even in the world\) who conducted deep research in the 80's on scales and transposition limited music structures like scales and chords.

\(Memo\) Subjects I'll write about :

* [Lydian chromatic concept of tonal organization](https://www.academia.edu/42781582/The_Lydian_chromatic_concept_of_tonal_organization_The_art_and_science_of_tonal_gravity)
* Transposition limited structures
* Combinatorial exploration of scales in tonal system
* Greek modes
* Atonality and dodecaphony
* Modal chords 
* Hyper chords
* Pandiatonicism

Theses are mostly high level music theories with which I want to reconnect with, but I'll write on more "mainstream" subjects too.

## Summary

* [Chords progression dictionary : to stop wasting time searching for chords when composing.](Chords%20progressions.md)
* Scales
	* [Harmonic Minor](Harmonic%20Minor.md)
