The Harmonic Minor scale is a 7 notes scale, with 7 modes. It has a kind of oriental feeling, because of its one and a half interval betwen the `b6th` and the `M7th`.

The two most usited ones are :
- Degree `I`, the harmonic minor. Played on `mM7,9,11,b13` chords. 
- Degree `V`, the super phyrgian. Played on `7,b9,11,b13` chords. 
- Degree `II`, no specific name. Played on `m7b5,b9,11` chords.

It's perfect to play on minor `II V I`, with minor harmonic on `II - V` and minor on `I`.
