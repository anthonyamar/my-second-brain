The one drop pattern is a classic 4/4 reggae pattern played by the drummer where the bass drum, the rimshot and the hi-hat are played together on the 2nd and 4th beat while playing groovy triplets on the remaining space using the hi-hat. 

This emphasize the "weak beats" and make better feel of the counter rhythm skank. It is also often accompagnied by the bass playing the root note with an accent on the 2nd and 4th beat. 

It's also a great thing to play and consider at the guitar, playing the skank on 

## Examples
We can hear this pattern in a lot of reggae song. [Crazy Baldhead - Bob Marley and the Wailers](Crazy%20Baldhead%20-%20Bob%20Marley%20and%20the%20Wailers.md) is a good song to hear this.
