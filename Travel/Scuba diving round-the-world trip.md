## Planning a scuba diving trip around the world

This is a crazy idea I have in my head since the start of 2021. COVID-19 stucked me in my home, and gave me the opportunity to create great [saving habits](Saving%20habit.md) and make my business profitable.

I reached a point on [Scuba diving](Scuba%20diving.md), where I now want to live a lot of different experiences. It took me two years to win confidence about diving skills, as well as certifications. 

When I'm watching the best destinations for diving, I'm really like I want to make it all. Egypt, Indonesia, French Polynesia, Mexico, New Caledonia, Australia, Maldives, Caraibes, Greece, Malta, Madagascar, Iceland, Israel... 

There's so much awesome diving site in the world that I want to do. So why not making a scuba diving round-the-world trip? 

I had the chance with my co-founder to create strong remote culture and a free travelling policy but I never fully take advantage of this. I never travelled alone either. This is a challenge that I can make maybe once in my life, and it's better to be done before I get too old, or my company get too big. 

So let's try to plan something like this. 

## Todo
Like the Chinese proverb says:
> A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step 

Before trying to get any flight ticket, let's break down some of the planning steps, by answering questions.

### Where?

- Countries where I have family?

### How much?
- How much will it cost, or different, how much money could I get out? 
- Planning every expenses
- What's the risks and how to count this?
- Once I know the amount, how much do I need to save money in order to be ready?
- If it's too much money, how about borrowing?
- How about creating a business model around the travel? Sponsors? Content creation?
- If this isn't profitable, how about planning some remote work 1 or 2 days per week? 

### When? 
- When do I start? 

### How long?
- How long can I be in travel mode without putting my business on pause?
- How long would I stay in each country?

### Who? 
- Do I go alone or do I find a travel partner?

### What?
- What are the pre-requisites?
