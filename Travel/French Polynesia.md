The capital city is Papeete, in Tahiti. French Polynesia is divided into five groups of islands :

## Diving

Widely known for it's [scuba diving](Scuba%20diving.md) sites, the best seasons to dive are from March to June and September to November. 

My targeted sites: 
- Tuamotu Archipelago, especialy Fakarava, Rangiroa and Tikehau. Known for their shark population.
- Society Islands Archipelago, especialy Tahiti, Moorea and Bora-Bora. 
- Marquesas Islands. For confirmed divers and big shark lovers. 

There's a lot of scientifical expeditions right there, like [Under The Pole](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE0NOambLVgrnu5l3eKD1XXfeFv4gH64S). They were working with the [CRIOBE](http://www.criobe.pf/) (Centre de Recherches Insulaires et Observatoire de l'Environnement) which is a CNRS antena in Moorea.
