## Diving
There's a lot of different diving sites because of the number of islands.
The best season are January, Febuary and from June to September. 

The best wreck diving sites are in Chuuk, with the Fujikawa Manu and the Shinkoku Manu. Wreck of +120m and +150m. 

For Palau, the closer side to Philippines and maybe one of the starting point of a travel to Micronesia, the main city is Koron, accessible from the Palau International Airport. There's a diving shop on the Main St. Hotels starts around 50€/night right there. 

The diving sites are Blue Holes, German Channel, [Jellyfish Lake](https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/unusual-place-of-the-month-jellyfish-lake/), the Helmet Wreck and the Chandelier Cave.
