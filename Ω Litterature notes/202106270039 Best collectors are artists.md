Collectors are artists at the very pinnacle of artistic endeavor. Like a painter, the palette is the things we own as a collector and our canva is wherever we chose to expose our collection. Instead of trying to focus on specific kind of things to collect, just collect what pleased and inspire you ([202106270036 Don't search for good taste, search for pleasant things](202106270036%20Don't%20search%20for%20good%20taste,%20search%20for%20pleasant%20things.md)). Combine them together and make something that is more beautiful and interesting than the sum of its part. 

Thinking like this, it's also easy to highlight how close [Digital garden](Digital%20garden.md) and cabinet of curiosities are. In digital gardening, notes are like the various objects we collect. Combining them together is like creating our collection. We could say that the [Zettelkasten](The%20zettelkasten%20method%20and%20how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes.md) slipbox is our personal cabinet of curiosities. 

Publishing the garden is like creating a museum, where each piece is an entry to the author's mind that reflect his perspective of the world through the choice of his notes (for digital gardeners) or his objects (for collectors)
