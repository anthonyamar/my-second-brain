Thinkingsolely about presents problems can sometimes be more difficult than thinking about solutions to previous problems. 

I.e thinking about "Why money is a great way to solve the trade problem" (cf. [Sapiens - A Brief History of Humankind - Yuval Noah Harrari](Sapiens%20-%20A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Humankind%20-%20Yuval%20Noah%20Harrari.md)) gives more insights on the money pros/cons than actualy thinking to the problem we have today with money and how to solve it.
