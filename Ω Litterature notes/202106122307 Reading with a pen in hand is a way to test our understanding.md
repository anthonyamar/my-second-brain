Reading with a pen in hand is a way to test what we learn because we need to restitute the concept and introduce it. 

It helps to counter re-reading and the mere-exposure effect (what we want to avoid in [Speed reading](Speed%20reading.md)?) that just make us *feel* smarter rather than actualy *becoming* smarter

Is this close to Richard Feymann learning technic? (Considering a concept learned only when we can restitute it, i.e., teach it.)

Still reading with a pen in hand for writing notes is deliberate practice. It's the same mechanism and output as having to teach a subject.
