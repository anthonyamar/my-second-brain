Learning isn't linear. We don't follow clear path with one identified thing to learn at each node. Instead, we're learning in a graph oriented way: each thing to learn (node), have the ability to point to several other nodes. It is also not one-way. We can go back and forth between nodes in a graph. This way, we can have faster learning curve and build strongest thoughts and skills.

The #slipbox combined with [Obsidian Graph view plugin](Graph%20evolution.md) is a very great tool for graph oriented learning.
