Spending hour to search for new things to enter in our collection will still be less interesting that having a good library ([~ My library - MoC](~%20My%20library%20-%20MoC.md))

Pushing the concept on [[Antilibrary]], we don't even have to read all the books. Having them lyhing around is enough to inspire on what collectors we'll like to acquire.
