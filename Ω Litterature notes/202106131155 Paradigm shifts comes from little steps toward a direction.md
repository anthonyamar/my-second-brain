Ideas does not pop randomly. Breakthrough paradigm shifts on new ideas comes from long little steps toward a direction instead of a big move. 

From latin noun "Novus", the word "new", is ethymologycaly meaning "different" or "unusual" rather than "unheard". (Luhmann)

Paradigm changes need to absolutely master the initial subject. It's only by knowing every pros and cons of a specific system and having a big reflexion on the model that we can come with a paradigm changes. Cf. Isaac Newton on gravity and Albert Einstein on Restraint relativity theory.
