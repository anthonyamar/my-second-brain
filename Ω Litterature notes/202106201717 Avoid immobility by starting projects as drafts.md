We shouldn't start anything with the aim of making something perfect as perfection doesn't exist. Any project should start as a draft to avoid immobility. By thinking about drafts rather than finished projects, we can move through the tasks we have to do with openess and think as iteration cycles on which we're getting our project closer to our goal.
