Reading with a dictionnary on the side isn't efficient at all. Like we said and know with the [Zeigarnik effect](Zeigarnik%20effect.md), we better have to write the word and come back to it later. 

Dictionnaries are helpful only to find an answer to a well formulated question: what's the meaning of this word?

Yet, using an encyclopediae as an extrinsic aid is about searching for facts, opposed to opinion. Facts are non discutable truths.
