Focus is highly important when we need to execute. We need to narrow our view and make abstraction of the surrounding "noise" ([202106172211 Focus isn't what we do but what we don't do](202106172211%20Focus%20isn't%20what%20we%20do%20but%20what%20we%20don't%20do.md)) to create focus.

But this single mindness isn't realy usefull when it comes to creativity. Creativity, generating unheard and unconvenationnal ideas require openmindness (in opposition to single-mindness). This psychological treat is called openess.
