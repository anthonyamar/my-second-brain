Zettelkasten make the act of choosing topic to write on absolutely seamless as we just need to search for clusters of connected notes in our slipbox. [Obsidian graph](Graph%20evolution.md) really helps on that, especially if we use higher the link force and link distance parameters to stuck clusters together and better highlight them. 

This is where the compound effect is very interesting (see: [202106122248 Storing notes in our slipbox is investing in ourself](202106122248%20Storing%20notes%20in%20our%20slipbox%20is%20investing%20in%20ourself.md)), because the more note we have, the more clusters we're creating, so the more materials we can write with the least effort possible. This can lead to a great amount of article, helpful in business models like [Writing on Medium](Writing%20on%20Medium.md).
