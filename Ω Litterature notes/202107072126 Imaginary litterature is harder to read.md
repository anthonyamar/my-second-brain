Beauty is much harder to analyse than truth. Thus, reading imaginary litterature (that one made to please the reader) will be harder to read. 

To read imaginary litterature, follow those three negative rules: 
- Don't try to neglect the effect that imaginary work on us: We need to let us dream around and interpret things
- Don't come to terms with the authors (contrary to analytical reading fifth law). Imaginary don't solve problems, nor state arguments
- Don't judge or critics with the same standards as non-fiction. We're not searchung for research completeness nor argument consistency.
