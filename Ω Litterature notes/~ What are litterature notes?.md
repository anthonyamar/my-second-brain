Litterature notes are notes that I take when reading material or watching things. They're not quote, but real reformulation of ideas and sentences I found interesting. I store it here in order to reuse it in the futur and, combined with [Fleeting note](Fleeting%20notes%20to%20capture%20thoughts.md), create [Permanent note](Permanent%20notes%20to%20link%20and%20develop.md) for specific subjects.

The 12 digits at the beginning of each title is the date at which the note was created. It acts as a [Zettelkasten](The%20zettelkasten%20method%20and%20how%20to%20take%20smart%20notes.md) ID and create a kind of temporality with notes.
