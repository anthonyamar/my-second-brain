I'm a huge fan of virtual reality. When I was younger, I'd watch the representations of this technology with an enthusiastic eye when seen in science fictions movies. Now that it's alive and efficient, it seems like a dream/futuristic technology come true!

For now, I only have the PS VR \(VR headset for PlayStation 4\) but I tested the most of available headsets on the market, even some military/industrial immersive environment during conferences in Paris, and what I can say, is that this technology is moving very fast! Here are some things I want to keep an eye on, and some useful links.

### HTC Vive

For me the best headset on the market for now, the graphics and the tracking accuracy is awesome!

### Occulus

I like the fact that Occulus is accessible in terms of pricing and that they develop an all-in-one wireless headset. I tried the Quest 2 when it came out, and I was surprise by the tracking accuracy although there's no specific tracking system other than built-in cameras.

### VR amusement parks

Playing VR games at home is not as great as playing in places design for VR. I really like the experience in VR amusement parks. Some are really innovative as they often provide highly immersive environment with haptic feedbacks and in room multi-player games. I prefer going to these place instead of buying a VR set myself.

* [Phobia and anxiety disorder treatments](https://psy.c2.care/en/anxiety-disorders-virtual-reality/). Some of my students had conduct a project on this subject, the healing stats are pretty high and the solution seems promising.
* History and reconstitution : I tested ["A look into the past"](https://www.thekotel.org/en/western_wall_sites/a_look_into_the_past/) when I was in Jerusalem, which is a reconstitution and history documentary about the Temple and the Western Wall. I really like immersive documentaries!
* [Museum tours](https://www.museumnext.com/article/how-museums-are-using-virtual-reality/). Just like the history and reconstitution. I had the opportunity to try a virtual tour of curiosity cabinet in an exhibition, depending on the graphics fidelity, it is really great as we can take our time and get closer to artworks. 
* [Architecture.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110016819300511) VR is promising in the architecture field as you can project yourself in a space. Especially for interior design.
