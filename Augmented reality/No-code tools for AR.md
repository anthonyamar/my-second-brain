## List of no-code tools to make AR things

For now I didn't tried any of these. Just bookmarked it and share it with my students for their projects. 
- [Spark AR](https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/) - The free AR tool by Facebook to create filters for Instagram
- [Overly](https://overlyapp.com/) - Build your own augmented reality content without code. I like the example of images becoming videos on magazines just like Harry Potter magic newspapers. Definitly want to try this one for the "[Personal digital art museum](Personal%20digital%20art%20museum.md)" project. 
- [Zapworks](https://zap.works/) - Create your own augmented reality experiences. Seems to be really great and have a lot of resources to start. 30 free trial and the starter package at 55â‚¬/month is a bit expansive IMO. 
- [UniteAR](https://www.unitear.com/) - Augmented reality platform for instant AR app creation. 
- [ViewAR](https://www.viewar.com/) - All-in-one augmented realtiy system. Seems to be the most technical one and allow code. 
- [Vuforia studio](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/vuforia/vuforia-studio) - Modernize training and work instructions. Like their focus axis on training and work only. Seems to be more for professionnals than hobbyists. 
- [Unity 3D](https://unity3d.com/unity/features/multiplatform/vr-ar) - One of the biggest software for 3D is also making VR and AR things. 
- [A Frame](https://aframe.io/) - JS framework for VR 3D, VR and AR experiences, so yes, with code only ðŸ˜„.
