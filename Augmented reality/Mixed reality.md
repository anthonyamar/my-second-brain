Mixed reality is in between the field of [Augmented reality](Augmented%20reality.md) and [Virtual reality](Virtual%20reality.md), where the reality is mixed with computer-generated elements. 

What's different here than AR, is that more than just having statics digital elements, you can totally interact with it by manipulating both physical and virtual items and/or environments. 

The most promising device now for MR is [Microsoft Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens).
