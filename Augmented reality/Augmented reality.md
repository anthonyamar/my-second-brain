Augmented reality (AR) is an ==interactive experience where real-world environement is augmented by virtual and computer-generated perceptual informations==. 

It is different than [Virtual reality](Virtual%20reality.md) (VR) where VR is a 100% computer-generated environement that you're evolving in. 

Like VR, AR can have multiple kind of perceptual informations, even if those are mostly visual, reality can be augmented by haptic, auditory, and more rarely, [somatosensory](Somatosensory.md) and olfactory senses. 

AR is now a general technology largely adopted. The best examples of massive adoption signs for AR are : 
- Pokemon Go
- Snapchat filters

Thoses are two major applications adopted by the public where computer-generated visuals are augmenting the reality by letting the user interact with. 

Like VR, the entertainement field is more represented in AR, but there's also a lot of other case where AR is a total revolution :
- Industry
- Education
- Art
- Marketing
- Health
