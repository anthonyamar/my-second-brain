Some AR devices :
- A smartphone. Because yes, AR is in the hand of everyone owning a smartphone with camera. Had you use Snapchat filters once? 
- [Microsoft Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens), seems to be the most promising device on the AR field. It track eye and hand mouvement using the embedded cameras. 
- [Magic Leap 1](https://www.magicleap.com/en-us/magic-leap-1), seems also very promising. It's the lightest heads up display available with only 316g. It works with a deported kind of computer Google Home size, that you can carry in your pocket (seems to be what they're showing on their pictures). 
- [Google Glass Entreprise edition](https://www.google.com/glass/start/). It did not vanish at all! I was totally thinking that Google killed this project forever but no. Instead of focusing on B2C, they're now focusing on B2B with improving efficiency on production and operational as its value proposition. 
- [Epson Moverio](https://www.epson.fr/products/see-through-mobile-viewer/moverio-bt-300). I didn't know until now that Epson made other products than printers, even less augmented reality devices. It's the cheapest of this list, and still seems interesting. By reading their landing page, I can say that they're mostly target professionnal dronists for FPV (First Person View) usage. It's obviously less powerful than the other devices, but still interesting to have game entry products like this one on AR.
