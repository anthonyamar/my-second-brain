Here's a non exhaustive list that try to be exhaustive of all the cover I had to learn since I started playing music. I learned some of them in its entirety, others only some parts. Some were part of my setlists in some gigs, some were suggestions from my students and others were just for my pleasure. The large majority are the ones I learned at the guitar, but there's also some that I learned on the bass, the piano or even the drums.  

It start to be a lot of music and I can't remember all of them so I better keep a list so I can refer to it when I'm searching for music to play. I'll also update the list with new sheets so I can quickly retrieve informations about the music such as chord sequence, melody, music sheet, rythm etc... 

I learned a lot of rock and reggae music when I started the guitar at 10, then start studying jazz since 18 years old so these are the genre I play the most. When I was teaching the guitar, I started to learn a lot of pop song with my fellow students. I had pupils from 5 years old to 80 years old, hence these pop song list.
