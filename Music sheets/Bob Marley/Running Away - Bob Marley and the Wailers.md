They are a bit out of tune on the record, it's nearer of G than F# but the song is usually played in F#m when Bob Marley is live.

## Lyrics
Ya running and ya running  
And ya running away  
Ya running and ya running  
And ya running away  
Ya running and ya running  
And ya running away

Ya running and ya running  
But you can't run away from yourself  
Can't run away from yourself  
Can't run away from yourself  
Can't run away from yourself  
Can't run away from yourself  
Can't run away from yourself

Ya must have done (ya must have done)  
Somethin' wrong (something wrong)  
Said: ya must have done (you must have done)  
Wo! Somet'hn' wrong (something wrong)  
Why you can't find the  
Place where you belong?

Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (running away)  
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (running away)  
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (running away)  
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (running away)  
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do (running away)

Every man thinketh his  
Burden is the heaviest (heaviest)  
Every man thinketh his  
Burden is the heaviest (heaviest)  
Ya still mean it: who feels it, knows it, Lord  
Who feels it, knows it, Lord  
Who feels it, knows it, Lord  
Who feels it, knows it, Lord

Ya running and ya running  
And ya running away  
Ya running and ya running  
And ya running away  
Ya running and ya running  
And ya running away

Ya running and ya running  
But ya can't run away from yourself  
Could ya run away from yourself?  
Can you run away from yourself?  
Can't run away from yourself  
Can't run away from yourself  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah - from yourself

Brr - you must have done somethin'  
Somethin', somethin', somethin'  
Somethin' ya don't want nobody to know about  
Ya must have, Lord, someth'in' wrong  
What ya must have done, ya must have done somethin' wrong  
Why you can't find where you belong?

Well, well, well, well, ya running away, heh, no  
Ya running away, ooh, no, no, no  
I'm not (running away), no, don't say that - don't say that  
'Cause (running away) I'm not running away, ooh (running away)  
I've got to protect my life, (running away)  
And I don't want to live with no strife. (running away)  
It is better to live on the housetop (running away)  
Than to live in a house full of confusion (running away)

So, I made my decision and I left ya (running away)  
Now you comin' to tell me (running away)  
That I'm runnin' away (running away)  
But it's not true (running away)  
I am not runnin' away (running away)

## Sheet and/or tab
The melody on "Ya running and ya running and ya running away" is just ascending the Gm scale until you hit the 4th (G A Bb C)

## Music analysis
Classic [reggae chord progression](Chords%20progressions.md#Reggae) with a [one drop pattern](One%20drop%20pattern.md). Bob Marley at his finest!

As usual, the meaning is very deep. It tells that even though you made something wrong, you can run away and but can't run away from yourself. You can't mentaly escape your errors. 

## Other versions
For sure, one of the best take is the one from the live Raimbow Theatre, London 77, mashed up with Running Away and Jamming.

I really like the cover of Matisyahu, with a very lean band and adding beatbox and a big freestyle dubwise part. Very hipnotic.
