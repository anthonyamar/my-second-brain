## Lyrics
Them crazy, them crazy  
We gonna chase those crazy  
Baldheads out of town  
Chase those crazy baldheads  
Out of town

I and I build the cabin  
I and I plant the corn  
Didn't my people before me  
Slave for this country  
Now you look me with your scorn  
Then you eat up all my corn

We gonna chase those crazy  
Chase them crazy  
Chase those crazy baldheads out of town

*scat*
Stidilila bip dip stap stip stildia do stap dou dadilia de la lele
Sta tuduli tuduli tuduli tuduli tuduli doup tidi
Stadialo stap steledede

Build your penitentiary, we build your schools  
Brainwashed education, tryin' to make us your fools  
Hate is your reward for our love  
Telling at us of your God above

We gonna chase those crazy  
Chase those crazy pumpheads
Chase those crazy baldheads
Out of the yard

*Dub wise*

We gonna chase those crazy  
Chase those crazy pumpheads
Chase those crazy baldheads
Out of the yard

Here come the conman  
Coming with his con plan  
We won't take no bribe 
We've got to stay alive

We're gonna  chase those crazy  
Chase those crazy baldheads
Chase those crazy baldheads
Out of the yard

## Music analysis
Classic Bob Marley song with a [classic reggae chord progression](Chords%20progressions.md#Reggae) and an awesome [one drop pattern](One%20drop%20pattern.md).


## Other versions

There's an alternate take of this song on the Rastaman Vibration album. 

For sure, one of the best take is the one from the live Raimbow Theatre, London 77, mashed up with Running Away and Jamming.
