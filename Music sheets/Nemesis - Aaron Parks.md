## Music analysis
To play this theme on the guitar, you need to tune in drop D to have the low Eb, or use a vibrato to low a half note your E string. 

Improvising on this is pretty great. I'm playing Abm on Abm (no way? ðŸ˜„&nbsp;), Em on Em, Bm on Dâˆ†13 and Abm on Db7sus49 (while paying attention to not rest on the major third). There's some great guide tones between Abm and Em that make this tune really enjoyable. 

What's interesting and not common though, is the obvious 7/4 time signature. The drum playing the open hi-hat on every beat is what's making it seamless and so musical. 

Also, this high B pedal on the piano, going through all the chords is something that add all the color. 

## Other versions
There's not many covers of this one. Mostly live version, not in great quality, but there's these two different lives with the awesome Kurt Rosenwinkel at the guitar. He's killing it everytime, what a tone!

Another live with Mike Moreno also killing it at the guitar, which is the man who play on the record:

## Notes
That was the song to play at the five and last year of my jazz music degree. I was at the first year at that time and totally fell in love with this song. So musical as well as very innovative and emotional. A perfect song for modern jazz rock guitarists.
