## Lyrics
Koffee come in like a rapture

Koffee come in like a rapture  
And everybody get capture  
Place lift up like helicopter  
When dem see di lyrics contractor  
Koffee come in like a rapture, yeah  
And everybody get capture, oi  
Place lift up like helicopter, yeah  
When dem see di lyrical doctor

Koffee hottin' up di temperature, fi dem see  
Me know dem envy but friend me fi end me  
Yo a first mi see people deh 'round me so plenty  
But mi pocket nuh empty, me need space, oh Lord, yeah, me  
See dem a watch me through a crack now  
A mussi true me have di ting pon lock down  
Sitting ina di Bentley, pickiny a di century  
Yuh drench mi but fi mi fiyah gon' blaze  
And a same way so me see di enemy a protest, oh  
And him couldn't come di closest, no  
A Koffee still a do the mostest  
A wah me do put in the work and trust the process  
Oh yes, a so we grind right now  
Koffee wid di, Koffee wid di prime time flow  
Time fi we accumulate di coins I know  
Mi say Jah gimme di, Jah gimme di signs like woah

Koffee come in like a rapture  
And everybody get capture  
Place lift up like helicopter  
When dem see di lyrics contractor  
Koffee come in like a rapture, yeah  
And everybody get capture, oi  
Place lift up like helicopter, yeah  
When dem see di lyrical doctor

Me tell dem Jah gimme no limit, no  
Dem seh Koffee but you a whole midget, grow  
But when me spit lyrics me doh fidget wid it, sho' did it  
Gold wid it like mi gold dig it, pro

Me nuh tell you from me was a child, me ready  
Di God weh me serve me seh him timely yuh see  
Me highly blessed, so you cyaan' spoil mi medi  
Yuh cyaan' pile me, Messi  
Mi too profound  
Kill dem wid verbs and wid di pronouns  
When me come around lif' up di whole town  
Any weh me show up is a show down, yeah  
Every African crew a bubble hotta dan stew  
We still nah build until the Vatican slew  
Mi will hold still until di Koffee tun blue  
Tell dem go and chill until di Koffee done brew, ooh

Koffee come in like a rapture  
And everybody get capture  
Place lift up like helicopter  
When dem see di lyrics contractor  
Koffee come in like a rapture, yeah  
And everybody get capture, oi  
Place lift up like helicopter, yeah  
When dem see di lyrical doctor

Koffee come in like a rapture  
Koffee come in  
Koffee come in like a rapture  
Koffee come in  
Koffee come in like a rapture

## Sheet and/or tab
The way to play it at the guitar is by using sixteenth note arpegios, playing with the 9th on the `Am` (`Bm`).  

## Music analysis
Chords are easy, rhythm isn't even if it's a basic 4/4. That's what make this song so interesting to me. The thing to have, is the accentuation and the chords switch : 
- Em is played on the & of 2 with an accent
- G is played on the & of 3, with a huge accent

That's this shift from bar 1 and 2 of the accent that make it hard to have at first but that interesting and dancy. 

## Other versions
The live version at tiny desk is very great!

I really like this acoustic version at the guitar, it's easy to understand what to play on this song when we accompany with just guitar and voice.

The entire live is awesome. Rapture is the 8th song on the track list.

A loop cover that show very well how the beat can be constructed. The tempo is a bit fast in my opinion but this girl is killing it!
