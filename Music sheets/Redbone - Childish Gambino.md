## Chords
The music was composed out of western tune, using a higher A as reference (something around 450hZ instead of 440). 

**Original key:** `F`
I like to play it in `B` to have the low E string at the guitar as the main bass, starting with `E` instead of `Bb`. 
**Verse and chorus**

| E   | F#  | G#m | %   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IV  | V   | VI  | %   |

**Bridge**

| G#m | C#m - - /B | A#7  | G#m | C#m - - /B | A#7    D# | 
| --- | ---------- | ---- | --- | ---------- | --------- |
| VI  | II - - /I  | VII7 | VI  | II - - /I  | V ->  III |


## Lyrics
`Verse` 
Daylight  
I wake up feeling like you won't play right  
I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right  
It made me put away my pride  
So long  
You made a nigga wait for some, so long  
You make it hard for a boy like that to go wrong  
I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh

`Bridge`
If you want it, yeah  
You can have it, oh, oh, oh  
If you need it, oooh  
We can make it, oh  
If you want it  
You can have it

`Chorus`
But stay woke  
Niggas creepin'  
They gon' find you  
Gon' catch you sleepin' (Oooh)  
Now stay woke  
Niggas creepin'  
Now don't you close your eyes

`Verse` 
Too late  
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late  
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid  
I'm trying not to waste my time

`Bridge`
If you want it, oh  
You can have it, you can have it  
If you need it  
You better believe in something  
We can make it  
If you want it  
You can have it, aaaaah!

`Chorus`
But stay woke  
Niggas creepin'  
They gon' find you  
Gon' catch you sleepin'  
Put your hands up on me  
Now stay woke  
Niggas creepin'  
Now, don't you close your eyes  
But stay woke  
Niggas creepin'  
They gon' find you  
Gon' catch you sleepin', ooh  
Now stay woke  
Niggas creepin'  
Now, don't you close your eyes

`Bridge + synth solo/riff (kind of)`
Baby get so scandalous, oh  
How'd it get so scandalous?  
Oh, oh, baby, you...  
How'd it get...  
How'd it get so scandalous?  
Ooh, we get so scandalous  
But stay woke  
But stay woke

## Sheet and/or tab
The main line in the intro and the chorus is mostly on `G#` natural minor scale, with an accentued B in it (as the `2M`) from the major scale. 

## Other versions
Obviously the awesome cover from The Main Squeeze with  a mind blowing guitar solo, on the bridges chords, taking support on the dominant chords to raise the tension :

The intimate loop cover from Angus Sr Watson, playing it in the key of Bb (half step down guitar tuning), playing the main riff using octaves and the voice melody with smooth bends :

I like the way he play the main riff with chords with his sweet hollow body stratocaster sound :

## Related songs
I like to play it in this key and connect it to songs like : 
- Slow Dancing in Burning Room - John Mayer
- Let's get it on - Marvin Gaye 
- I want you back - Jackson Five

## Notes
Main song of the horror movie Get Out. The lyrics are deeply related to the movie. What is interesting, is how [contrapuntal](Contrapuntal%20music%20(in%20film).md) the music is compared to the film.
