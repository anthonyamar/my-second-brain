## Famous company's pitch deck
We can't talk about [fundraising](Fundraising.md) without talking about pitch deck. Creating an impacting pitch deck is an art in itself. What to put in? How to design? What's the plan? What numbers do I choose? Who I send it to? 

Let's take inspiration of famous company's decks :
