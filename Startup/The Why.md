This talk was a real game changer for me and allow me to think totaly differentely about my startup and a lot of other things in my life. Knowing why I'm doing what I'm doing helps me keep a course. It's always easier to find the How and the What of a project when you know your Why. 

It's at the limit of esoterism, as thinking really deep about this is more answering to a meta-physical question than a basic startup question. And yet, I still don't think there's a definitive answer to that. The way we're communicating the Why of a project can evolve through the time, but still keep its essence. 

The Why is part of the decision framework made popular by Simon Sinek called the Golden Circle. It helps make trade-offs in projects by submiting it to the Why: Is this decision (feature, strategy shift, buying...) is the best and most efficient way to serves our Why? This framework really helps to have our feet straight on the ground but also seeing innovations, let's take exemple on trains and planes: what if, trains company, when planes come first, described them as company transporting people from A to B in most efficient way (ratio speed/security) instead of just describing them as train company? They would have taken the shift and start to diversify themselves.
