The concept of MVP (standing for Minimum Viable Product) comes from *The Lean Startup*, Eric Ries' iconic book. Creating a MVP is about building a product that aim to deliver the most basic form of a value proposition with the least possible resources in order to build traction. 

A MVP is far from being perfect and shouldn't be perfect at all. Its puprose is only to be just enough to solve the problem you're searching to solve and to demonstrate the value you're trying to prove. 

This is the foundation of any #startup and any product and should be the first thing to do when trying to create a business. 

Eric Ries' formal definition: 
> “(The) version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort” — *Eric Ries, The Lean Startup*
