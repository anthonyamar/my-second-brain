## My journey in the world's biggest startup campus

We've been fortunate to join [Station F](https://stationf.co/) with my #startup  [Studiomatic](https://www.studiomatic.co/en/) in january 2021 ! ðŸŽ‰

Station F is a 51000 square meters startup campus in Paris, backed by [Xavier Niel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_Niel) (a very famous entrepreneur in France) where more than a thousand startups from all over the world are following programs. There's more than 30 programs, mostly industry and stage specific, managed by big company like Facebook, Microsoft, Ubisoft, LVMH, Astra Zeneca or by Station F itself. We succeed to join the most coveted one : the [Founders Program](https://stationf.co/apply/#t-founders). 

I'll share you here my journey at Station F, from the day we applied. 

## What we're doing in Station F, in short
As the word "campus" might help, Station F is an hybrid place between an incubator, a school and a living place with a big community. The goal, obviously, is to grow faster than if you were alone. Station F provide equipment, infrastructures, resources, staff and mentors, puting you in best conditions possible to achieve a faster growth. 

## The apply

Everything starts by applying. Each programs have it's own schedule and apply process. Depending on what you want to achieve, your industry, your stage etc, you apply to one or another program. 

I.e. : Faceook program is for #artificial-intelligence startups, LVMH for luxury tech, Ubisoft for gaming and entertainment while others are only for students or only for unprivileged people. 

For the Founders Program, the apply is in 2 steps, each online and lasts something around 4 months. We applied 3 times and get refused 2 times, all during the first step. 

The first step is a form you fill online, with a lot of questions about you, your startup, your team, your vision, your product, if you already fundraised or not, your KPIs. (I'm not sure I remember, but I think they'd also asked for a deck). 

This step is the most difficult one because you're in competition with a lot of startups. They say that they have something like 5000 applicants each time, and that they take only 100 startups for the second step. 

Your application is reviewed by a comitee of 100 top notch entrepreneurs that are checking if you :
- Match the pre-requisits : early stage startup with big ambitions, working full time
- Are aligned with Station F values : active in community, sucker for resources
- Ok with the 205â‚¬ monthly fees (ridiculous comparing to the cost of a coworking place in Paris)
- You have a PoC and KPIs
- You want to work in Paris
- You have the right mindset (don't come if you want to get babysitted)

If your profile match with all of this, you might be choosen to go on the second and last step, which is a kind of screening interview in video, but without the interviewer. 

You're not provided with the questions you might have to answer or any kind of this, so it's a bit hard to prepare. All the team must be present, the questions must be answered in english and in 1 to 2 minutes maximum with 30 seconds of reading an preperation (there's a timer on the screen). We had something like 10 to 12 questions and it was mainly about our vision, our values and very specific questions. 

We had something like :
- The classic "introduce yourself and where do you met with your partners"
- Short pitch
- "Who're your clients and what are you selling them?"
- "How do you bring diversity in your company?"
- "If someone who's making the same things as you, but with lot more money and resrouces jump in your office what would you do?"
- "How do you solve conflicts between you and your cofounders?"

*<mark class="red">Disclaimer</mark> : Here, I'm just relating how the apply went for us. Please, don't take anything as the only truth or advices, processes might changes for every new batch.*

To be honest, it was quite anxious. We'd prepared the best we could, we had notes in english about our KPIs, pitch, market, customers, values etc, but some questions wasn't what we prepared at all. We did our best to stay ourselves and answer what we trully thought. It was also a bit more difficult for us because we had to improvise in a foreign language! 

At the end, we were neutral about our performance, more like *"Ok, we did what we could, let's see now".*

One month later, we received an email from Station F with a title saying:
> Congratulations, you did it! ðŸŽ‰


And we were very happy! ðŸ˜„
