## Fundraising for startups

I think fundraising is the most discussed #startup topic. Fundraising can be in short resume in "Exchange company capital for cash". This is a process that takes time and where informations are scattered everywhere.

We had a lot of wise advices about fundraising and, as this is a process we're on right now with [Studiomatic](https://www.studiomatic.co/en/), I'm taking a lot of notes about, searching for articles, advices, checklists, etc... So let's share it here!

<mark class="red">Disclaimer</mark> : Fundraising is far from being an absolute science. But what I'm sure, is that the process is very different depending on your company, country, metrics, industry, business-model, advancement, contacts and experience... Theses notes are made through the prism of my own company and experience in the french ecosystem so they might not be true for you, your startup and your ecosystem. 

## Where to start when fundraising
When I ask this to my friends, other CEOs, investors or even Google, I often get this answer : ==start by knowing why you want to fundraise==.

Starting a fundraising need to be crystal clear about why you want to raise, how much and how you'll spend the money. 

## Why you need to raise money
Because there's some good and some bad reasons. 

### ❌ Bad reasons
- You have an idea and you need money to create your product
- You want to test a new #business-model 
- You need money to save your company from bankruptcy 
- You think this is the only way to have money as a startup
- You think this will make you famous

### ✅ Good reasons
- Your company is growing and you want to go faster
- You have a profitable business-model that you can scale or repeat and you want money to go big on this
- Your business work on a city and you want to open new cities or countries
- You want to hire more people and scale because you see opportunities

## Seed
The first fundraising a startup does is called a "seed round". Depending on the round you're trying to achieve, the rules differs. 

Notes about the seed round :
- From 300k€ to 1.5m€
- Mostly from business angels (BA) and seed round venture capitalists (VC)
- Startups with a working Proof of Concept (PoC)
- Mostly about the team, the vision and the product
- Great KPIs are (not exhaustive, depending on your field) :
	- From 10k€ VAT excluded monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
	- A traction proof like 10k users for free B2C apps
	- First big account for B2B apps
	- Working prototype and crowdfunding or 1k user waiting list for hardware products
	- 20% Month over Month growth (MoM growth) on your main KPI
- Mean dilution about 25% (from 20% to 30%)
- From 1m€ to 2.5m€ pre money valuation

## Mixing funding sources strategy
When a startup announce that it raise a certain amount of money, it's always a package of varied money sources. Not every penny is risk money. 

In France, the common way to raise money is to make a 40/40/20 split share with :
- 40% in risk capital : money from BA and/or VC in exchange of company shares
- 40% in grant and subsidies : in France, mostly the [BPI](https://www.bpifrance.fr/)
- 20% in debt : money from banks with or without interests. 

The proverb "Money calls money" is so true here, as ==each step is use to leverage the following one==. Let's say you're raising 1m€ :
1. You do your best to raise 400k€ from in risk capital. 
2. With now 400k€ in treasury, you can leverage public grants with a minimum of cash required at a 1-1 ratio. Means that : you raised 400k€, the subsidy abounds another 400k€. 
3. The publics subsidies comes not only with money but also with states guaranties. Using this guaranty, you can go to the bank and leverage a loan at a 1-2 ratio. The bank is now more akind to accept, because you both have states guaranties from your previous money round and a significant financial contribution. 

## VC lists
When raising money, choosing which VC to contact is extremely important : raising money isn't only about money, is also a lot about finding new partners that would advise your company during good and bad times. Choosing the right partners is  important. 

Also, VC don't invest in every company. They're following what we called an "investment thesis", which is the kind of company they're puting money. When searching to contact VC, make sure they criteria matches your company:
- Funding stage (pre-seed, seed, post-seed, A series, B series...)
- Field of expertise (SaaS, B2B, B2C, deep-tech, bio-tech, food-tech, music-tech...)
- Average ticket in € (I.e, don't reach a VC with 1m€ min ticket if you're raising 200k€)
- Predilection countries
- Funded portfolio

If your startup is in an incubator or an accelerator, you can ask for introductions, wich is the best way to have your first contact. Some of them, like [Station F](My%20journey%20at%20Station%20F.md), have dedicated online spaces and advisors for helping about fundraising and getting contact with VC and BA.
