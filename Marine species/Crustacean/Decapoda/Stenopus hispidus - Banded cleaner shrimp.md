*[108 - 2023-02-25 - Kay Maréchal - Saint Pierre - Martinique](108%20-%202023-02-25%20-%20Kay%20Maréchal%20-%20Saint%20Pierre%20-%20Martinique.md) - There's obviously a lot to say on that picture. There's two shrimps even if though it seems that there's more. They're hidden in one (or two different?) sponges that can be [Svenzea zeai - Dark volcano sponge](Svenzea%20zeai%20-%20Dark%20volcano%20sponge.md), colonized by the endemic [Bergia puertoricense - Maroon sponge zoanthid](Bergia%20puertoricense%20-%20Maroon%20sponge%20zoanthid.md). It's narrower picture of the firtst picture in [Davidaster rubiginosus](Davidaster%20rubiginosus%20-%20Golden%20crinoid.md) (the little piece of crinoid arm on the lower left corner). It's very likely that they are in couple.*

*[110 - 2023-02-26 - Jardins Precheur - Saint Pierre - Martinique](110%20-%202023-02-26%20-%20Jardins%20Precheur%20-%20Saint%20Pierre%20-%20Martinique.md) - First thought it was a different specie, but after taking time to closely watch and count the antenas and the claws, it seems to be this one. The kind of biotope is also the same. I just think the colors aren't good because of the light and/or my camera settings.*

## Notes
As their name could let us understand: they're cleaning stations, removing parasites to the animals with which they're in symbiotic association. It's a common shrimp in the caraibean sea, in porifera mostly and any kind of infractuosities where they can live. 

They have 6 antenas, that's why it's sometimes difficult to see how many individuals there is in a specific place.
