*[122 - 2023-05-14 - Aspo faro - Epidaurus - Greece](122%20-%202023-05-14%20-%20Aspo%20faro%20-%20Epidaurus%20-%20Greece.md) - I was mad, it was the first time I saw this pretty rare species, a protected one in Mediterranean sea, and I find out later that my camera wasn't on the correct mode... It was the first dive of the journey, so I had some technical difficulties* ðŸ˜„
## Notes
Protected species because it has been overfished. We can find it on overhangs and cave roofs.
