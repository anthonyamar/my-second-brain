*[112 - 2023-02-27 - Pointe Lamarre - Saint Pierre - Martinique](112%20-%202023-02-27%20-%20Pointe%20Lamarre%20-%20Saint%20Pierre%20-%20Martinique.md) - It's a very difficult shrimp to picture, as it is very small (about a centimeter maximum), and always hidden in anemones.*

## Notes
As crazy as it may seems, the name is the real scientific name, proposed by Anker & Baeza in 2021, accepted by the scientific corpus. The specie is finely describe on https://treatment.plazi.org/GgServer/html/7C51094E195AFFF5AEBCFB17501453E8 - It's very interesting to see how much detail they provided in order to value their new specie.

> *Etymology. This beautiful and charismatic new species of Thor is named after the well-known actor and environmental activist Leonardo DiCaprio for his continuous engagement in the protection of biodiversity (including coral reefs and other tropical marine habitats) through various conservation projects, and for bringing more attention to the catastrophic effects of the global climate change. Used as a noun in apposition.*
> 
> *Common names suggested. Leonardo DiCaprio’s sexy shrimp; banded-antennae squat shrimp.*

I was told that it was the Periclimenes yucatanis, but this one has bigger antenas and purple, also bigger, paws and clamps. But the color are the same, with those remarkable white circled with purple on a dark orange tegument.
