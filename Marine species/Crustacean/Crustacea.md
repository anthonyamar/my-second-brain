Crustacea is a well very complex subphylum (in the Arthropda phylum, wich is one of the biggest phylum in terms of diversity) that encompass a lot of different taxons. We can distinguish crustacean using their key features: 
- Bilaterian
- Presence of an articulated shell in two part, called a cephalothorax
- A metamerized abdomen
- Composed eyes
- Different use of antenas
- Mostly benthic and moving (the curious cirripeds taxon is composed of sessils species, copepods are planctons...) 

We can find common animals like:
- Shrimps
- Crabs
- Lobsters
- Hermit crabs
- Sea spiders
- Copepods (plancton)
- Isopodes (parasites)
- Barnacles (sessile organism of the [Mediolittoral](Mediolittoral.md))

The most common group is the [[Decapoda]]
