I was suprised to see this species in the Mediterranean sea. As it was in Greece, we can suppose that it came from the Red Sea through the Suez Canal, or just was introduced, just like in the carribean sea.*

## Notes
This one is the common species, the one that invaded the cara√Øbean sea desipte that it comes from the indian ocean. Recognizable by it's more pronounced radiated aspect than the [Pterois cincta - Red Sea lionfish](Pterois%20cincta%20-%20Red%20Sea%20lionfish.md). 

Like any scorpenidae, it's a venimous and voracious species. Take care when diving by night in areas where there's a lot of these species, espacialy with the lights. They are attracted by the light during night and can come from nowhere to go on the light. If you point your light on any fish, it will see it and try to eat it.
