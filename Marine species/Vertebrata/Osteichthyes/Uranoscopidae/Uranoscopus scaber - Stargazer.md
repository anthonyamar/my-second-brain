*[127 - 2023-05-17 - Labyrinthe de Zeus - Epidaurus - Greece](127%20-%202023-05-17%20-%20Labyrinthe%20de%20Zeus%20-%20Epidaurus%20-%20Greece.md) - When I saw that head, I jumped. I had lying in the sand, concentrating to take a great picture of the [Phoronis australis - Cerianthid phoronid worm](Phoronis%20australis%20-%20Cerianthid%20phoronid%20worm.md), and feel that fish moving under my belly. I was fortunate not to be hurt, because this fish is venimous, and also give electric shocks. Once I saw it, he moves 2 or 3 meter far, and buried it self again, just revealing its eyes. It wasn't moving so I could take some pictures. The fun part, is that my teacher yeld at me because the [Cerianthus membranaceus - Cylinder anemone](Cerianthus%20membranaceus%20-%20Cylinder%20anemone.md) on which was the Phoronis had vanish because I jumped, make him fail its picture.* ðŸ˜„
