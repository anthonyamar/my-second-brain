Species from the Cnidaria phylum are the most difficult ones to identify (at least, for myself as a begginer). They can have totaly different physical characteristcs, but are brought together because they all have a cnidocyte.

Cnidaria is a phylus that shelter :
- Jellyfish
- [Heteractis magnifica - Magnificent sea anemone](Heteractis%20magnifica%20-%20Magnificent%20sea%20anemone.md)
- Corals
- [Gorgonians](Scleraxonia%20&%20Halaxonia%20sp.%20-%20Gorgonians.md)
- Hydra

The three important class to know at first are the [Anthozoa](Anthozoa.md), [Hydrozoa](Hydrozoa.md) and [Scyphozoa](Scyphozoa.md). 

They nearly all are predators, killing by paralysis. Their sting can cause harmful epidermic reactions on humans, and some pain can last more than months. 

## Cnidocyte
The unique characteristic of the cnidaria phylum is their cnidocyte. The cell responsible for the stingness. When the cnidocil is stimulated, it will create a mechanic reaction that will discharge the cnidocyste through the operculum at speed of 700 nanoseconds. They can feed themselves using this, by capturing microorganisms such as plankton, larvae, copepods...
