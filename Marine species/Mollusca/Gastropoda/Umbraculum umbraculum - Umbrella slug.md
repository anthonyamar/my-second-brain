*[126 - 2023-05-16 - Delta - Epidaurus - Greece](126%20-%202023-05-16%20-%20Delta%20-%20Epidaurus%20-%20Greece.md) - It seems that Umbraculum is a monotypic genus (or at least 2, but the second isn't really documented), even though individuals tends to have big differences between each others. Its head is on the top, in the shadow, and kinda looks like a nudibranchia/slug head, with two black proto-eyes looking like dots. This individual had around a 15cm radius.*
