*[128 - 2023-05-17 - Pirate des Cara誰bes - Epidaurus - Greece](128%20-%202023-05-17%20-%20Pirate%20des%20Cara誰bes%20-%20Epidaurus%20-%20Greece.md) - I had the opportunity to picture a lot of different octopus, but this is my best picture so far! It wasn't hide, as it saw us, it started to move and stoped here and I had minutes to configure my lights, do the focus and shoot that picture. Very cooperative.*

We can see that it has its skin's head spiked. It's because he feel a threat.

They hide theirselves using differents shells and remains. If you see one, start searching for the animal that should be in, or around. It also, mostly, can be abandoned.*
