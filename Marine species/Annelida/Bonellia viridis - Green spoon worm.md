*[126 - 2023-05-16 - Delta - Epidaurus - Greece](126%20-%202023-05-16%20-%20Delta%20-%20Epidaurus%20-%20Greece.md) - This is the fin black fillament with the ending Y shape. Yes, it's an animal!*
## Notes
The visible part of this worm is that fin black/green filament that end with a Y shape. It's always the female that we saw, because Bonellia accuse hard sexual dimorphism. The male(s - actually, it can shelter more than 80 males, in maximum. Damn!) is inside the female (the worm itself is hidden in the substraste and looks like a bean) to fill it with its gamete. The filament is used to capture and move food to the animal.

The horn can retract itself if it feel some current or predator, and can even regenerate itself if it has been harmed.
