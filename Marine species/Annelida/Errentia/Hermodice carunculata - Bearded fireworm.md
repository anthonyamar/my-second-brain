*[123 - 2023-05-15 - L'Aquarium I - Epidaurus - Greece](123%20-%202023-05-15%20-%20L'Aquarium%20I%20-%20Epidaurus%20-%20Greece.md) - I succeed to have this macro photo that I'm proud of! We can see a lot of the anatomy of the anelida in general. The parapodia are on both side of the animal, used to move. The gills, the little red bush on each parapodia, is a part of their breathing system. The caruncle are on the head, kind of small growths. The white little bush are the bristles. If it touches the human skin, it inject a powerful neurotoxin that produce painful irritations. They're out because the animal feel some stress environment (the water moving due to my presence). We distinctly see all the different segments, result of the metamerism.*

I followed this direction and found that. Those worms can smell death from a big distance through chemoreception, then move to it until they find their meal. I think this is a fish throwed by a fisherman. There was at least 15 individuals.*

I think they're reproducing, that's why I took this picture. On a [Xestospongia muta - Barrel sponge](Xestospongia%20muta%20-%20Barrel%20sponge.md)*

It's really difficult to identify the specie that it came, maybe not H. carunculata, but still interesting to know how it can look like.*

## Notes
The first time I saw one, I was very proud, like it's a rare animal. But then, I saw some during each dive, so I know now that it's common. I stoped taking pictures of it, except if it's during a specific life scene. 

Do not touch it, it hurts a lot!
I saw some in caraibean sea, as well as in Greece, oriental mediterranean sea.
