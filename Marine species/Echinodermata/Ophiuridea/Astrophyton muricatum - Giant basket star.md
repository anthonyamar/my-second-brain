It's curious, because, hidden like this, I can't imagine how it will deploy its arm and get fed... Maybe by the current flow made by the sponge. I don't remember if there was current or not in this dive, but it is very likely to.*

## Notes
This animal can deploy its arm by night and reach more than 1m in span. I never saw one by night unfortunately, but would love it!

By day, they looks like a giant knot bag. What we see is the arms completely folded.  

In France, it's an animal that I saw maybe once in ~50 dives. Very rare and not higher than 30m. In Martinique, I saw some at every dive, I even stopped to picture them... ðŸ˜„
