description: Enter the wonderful world of marine-biology through gorgeous underwater pictures of marine animals. Ctenophora is a translucide animal that looks like a jellyfish but is not. It's one of the older animal to have evolve.

## Notes
Ctephora are intriguing animals. We don't really know where they need to be place in the phylogenetic tree, but seems to be one of the older animal to evolve. This species causes a lot of trouble for industrial and biodiversity. It was introduced in the Black Sea by accident and causes to reduce by a really big factor the fishs biomasses, because it eats every eggs in the water, and reproduce really fast, without enough predators. 

Its predator is another ctenophora, the Beroe ovata. We don't have a lot of this species in France, but it can be a problem if we start to see it more. 

The reproduction cycle is very fast. They can create a new small adult in only 20 hours, that will be able to reproduce itself after 13 days.
