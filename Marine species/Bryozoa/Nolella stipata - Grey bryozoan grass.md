It's those little white hair or kind of we see around the sponge. These aren't algae, nor annelida, but bryozoans. My teacher had to do research for this. He also told me that the sand shape white things aren't actualy sand, but foraminifera, so animals...* üòÖ

It's the things that looks like grey grass, like thick and dressed hairs. We distinctly see it on the sponge just on the middle/bottom. The sponge is [Agelas oroides - Orange agelas](Agelas%20oroides%20-%20Orange%20agelas.md). *

## Notes
Seems to be common, once we understood that it's not an algae, we start seeing things way differently and think everything is an animal.
