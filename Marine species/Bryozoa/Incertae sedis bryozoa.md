Bryozoa are very different animal than the kind of idea we have of animals. Just like [Porifera (sponges)](Porifera%20(sponges).md), two speices can look the same but actualy be very different species. External features aren't always the key identification features. Don't hesitate to [Contact me üíå](Contact%20me%20üíå.md) if you know more about thoses species, happy to discuss! ‚ò∫Ô∏è

*[127 - 2023-05-17 - Labyrinthe de Zeus - Epidaurus - Greece](127%20-%202023-05-17%20-%20Labyrinthe%20de%20Zeus%20-%20Epidaurus%20-%20Greece.md) - There were a tire, laying on the sea floor, colonized by sponges and algea. In the tires, was that white-y-spot. I'm pretty sure it's a bryozoa, but which one... The nearest match I got is [Schizoporella unicornis](https://doris.ffessm.fr/Especes/Schizoporella-unicornis-Schizoporella-unicorne-3638/(rOffset)/0). The picture is too blurry to really identify it, because we can't zoom on the zoids. Also close to [Figularia figularis](https://doris.ffessm.fr/Especes/Figularia-figularis-Bryozoaire-berceau-lapon-3582/(rOffset)/14)*.
