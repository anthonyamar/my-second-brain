*[130 - 2023-05-18 - Aspo faro - Epidaurus - Greece](130%20-%202023-05-18%20-%20Aspo%20faro%20-%20Epidaurus%20-%20Greece.md) - I'm very proud of this picture, because I had a lot of trouble making a great focus on transparent and pellagic animals like ctenophora or jellyfishes. This one is neat! We can observe the key identifications that make this animal belongs to the thaliacea: the transparent tunic (that doesn't loose its shape once puting out of water contrary to jellyfish or ctenophora) and the siphons that are totally opposed, contrary to common ascidiacea.*

## Notes
This animal can stick with other mate and create a colonie that look like a sort of chain, or a belt, and move by the current. It can be long of several tens of centimeters.
