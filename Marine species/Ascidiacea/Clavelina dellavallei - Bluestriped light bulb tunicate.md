*[124 - 2023-05-15 - L'Aquarium II - Epidaurus - Greece](124%20-%202023-05-15%20-%20L'Aquarium%20II%20-%20Epidaurus%20-%20Greece.md) - I love this picture, the animal looks fairy. Actually, we can understand a lot of things on ascidiacae with this picture. The white particles that we see here aren't sand or anything like this, but the food that is moving through the body spirals, from the top siphon (inhaling) to the peduncle on the bottom, where we can notice the digestive system. Once the food is consumed, the lasting water is exhaled through the siphon on the side, which is why it is more transparent than the rest of the body.*

It's interesting also to see that they can lives socialy.*
