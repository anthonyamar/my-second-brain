*[124 - 2023-05-15 - L'Aquarium II - Epidaurus - Greece](124%20-%202023-05-15%20-%20L'Aquarium%20II%20-%20Epidaurus%20-%20Greece.md) - This picture is analysed and was listed in [Serpula vermicularis - Red tubicolous worm](Serpula%20vermicularis%20-%20Red%20tubicolous%20worm.md) (the worm on the middle). I think of C. crambe here because this side was receiving light from above, and the presence of those shapes that looks like [Arca noae](https://doris.ffessm.fr/Especes/Arca-noae-Arche-de-Noe-118), the bivalvia gives clues. A. noae is colonized by C. crambe, not [Spirastrella cunctatrix - Orange encrusting sponge](Spirastrella%20cunctatrix%20-%20Orange%20encrusting%20sponge.md)*
## Notes
Common sponge in mediterranean sea. 

Can be confused with [Spirastrella cunctatrix - Orange encrusting sponge](Spirastrella%20cunctatrix%20-%20Orange%20encrusting%20sponge.md), wich look really the same. We can barely differentiate them by their environment and their relation to light. C. crambe is photophile, S. cunctatrix is [sciaphyle](Sciaphyle.md).
